Why can't NASA get to the Moon like it did before? What can we do about it?

Fundamentally, it was a different beast in the 60s. The US spent 10 years, laser focused on putting a man on the moon with one of the most united congress in US history. They had focus, funding, risk, and simplicity. Some of these things can easily be re-done and others probably not so much. 

1. Focus
In the 60s the democrats *dominated* both the presidency and congress, and the president as the bully pulpit could easily direct that political capital towards one, simple goal: put a man on the moon. 

There were no changes in scope, scale, administrative policy, and no significant requests for any additional stakeholders. 

2. Funding
In the 60s, the US spent 3% of the US budget or something like $5 billion on NASA, almost solely on the Apollo program. The modern Artemis program 60 years later sees about the same budget so they are being asked to do much the same and then some with less. 

3. Risk
Hard to quantify, but in the 60s NASA as well as the Astronauts knew they were in for a huge risk with spaceflight. That risk simply isn't accepted these days and makes systems more complicated and testing more extensive. 

There is a case to be made that the increased work resulting from this is probably worth it

4. Simplicity
The scope of the apollo mission was land on the moon. That is it, no more, no less. Modern day missions obviously don't want to just repeat that and building a habitat on the moon with a gateway to Mars is obviously more complicated.
