Ezra Klein and TBD wrote a book they named abundance. It lays out a vision for a path forward for a democratic platform to adopt as a counter, in part, to the status quo. I'd encourage anyone to read the book, it's not very long and currently represents a bit of a bible for an entirely "new" way of thinking. It's not really a new way of thinking but it does represent a change from, again, the status quo. 

My biggest takeaway of the book is basically this:

1. We can assure that there is more than enough to go around
2. Get NIMBYs out of the way
3. Get government out of the way of government
4. Fund innovation

In a vacuum, I think this is an entirely rationale platform to adopt. Far too often, we see statements or dictates that we must conserve, or that we should relinquish old habits to ostensibly make the world a better place. There are a few reasons why I don't support that ideology and instead why abundance should be embraced. 

### Leftist Hippies

The first problem I have is what I would call the commune leftists. This isn't really any one group, but routinely I see people endorse philosophies of growing local produce, supporting local craftsmen, engaging in the local community, reject big business and automation, etc. And on the face there's obviously no issue with this but it really does at times seem like the ideal vision of these groups as a whole is some kind of utopian commune we read about in U.S. history like the Oneida community or the shakers or even the Amish. Tell a single mother to her face to go to the farmers market and buy a $10 melon, and you're libel to get a slap in the face. 

### Degrowth 

There are other philosophies about "growth for the sake of growth" is irrational, and that we should be happy with what we have.

### Class Warfare

The biggest obstacle here is that people simply misidentify the culprit. Sure, watering your lawn less or eating all the food you buy from the grocery store are solid ideas. Waste is no good, but in this case the cause to me is more moral than it has any impact. 

The truth is, some 90%+ of all water goes to the agriculture industry. The vast majority of food waste is not from homeowners. Large industry emits far and away the largest source of pollution. 

## Progressives Miss the Mark

I think the biggest mistake progressives can make regarding the "abundance agenda" is letting it be adopted by the neoliberals. It's a powerful message that is not incompatible with progressive ideology. I mean the core of it is literally making the state more able to provide for people but yet it's somehow spun into some deregulatory neolib philosophy and it really just shows that people don't know what they're talking about when they use that critique. To reference the book itself, that's behavior I would expect of the right but is inexcusable for the left. I didn't know progressives had adopted the NIMBYs and that's shameful. 

The whole point is that large blue cities are the most expensive places in the world to live, and to build in. I have yet to see a progressive ideology that acknowledges this beyond saying "don't worry the rich will pay for it", but the question still stands. Why does it cost $2bn per mile for a subway in NYC. Why is rent in the bay the most expensive in the world. 

It gets to one of my biggest critiques of current progressives which is that they are always finding an enemy to blame instead of figuring out a path forward. It's the corporations buying up homes, not the NIMBY homeowners. The voters didn't vote for Joe, the party screwed Bernie despite Warren staying in and the generally crowded moderate field. 

Sometimes they need to own up to the harsh truth if they ever want to actually move forward. There is no reason at all why we can't have our cake and eat it. 

In any case, my read of the book is that the main point is this: get NIMBYs out of the way of government, get government out of the way of government, identify bottlenecks, and let the government help build us a future where we don't have to fight over resources.

I think where the left gets it wrong is that 1) they think it's about deregulating private industry instead of government itself 2) that they are still stuck with 'everything bagel' thinking and that no compromise on priorities will work and 3) that this is incompatible with a progressive agenda when it very clearly is about empowering the state.
