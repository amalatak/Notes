The democratic party is in shambles right now. They are locked out of power in the house, senate, supreme court, and the presidency; and to top it all off there's a case to be made that they lost all of that against an eminently beatable opponent, more on that later. 

So the question is, locked out of power and historically unpopular, what went wrong and where do they go from here? 

## What went wrong

There are a dozen different theories that can be strung together to contribute to the cause of the 2024 democratic election loss. Some of the biggest reasons being that 

1. The Harris campaign didn't have enough time
2. Harris was burdened by being "anointed"
3. The campaign was weighed down by Biden's reputation
4. Harris is a woman
5. She was too far left
6. She was too moderate
7. The general conditions weren't conducive to an incumbent victory all over the globe

There are many more reasons, I'm sure, but these are the ones that stand out the most to me. 

## A Path Forward



### Useless rambling history

Let's start from the beginning, which in this era is around 1980. The Reagan era, small government, neoliberal coalition was more or less born out of the chaos of the late 60s and 70s. There are myriad reasons for this ranging from oil crises to racists abandoning the democrats because of the civil rights bill to Vietnam. In any case, that era was over and for the next 30 years until the great recession there was nothing but neoliberalism. 

One could say Obama was a turning point, but I would say he ended up not really changing that much, his main staple the ACA being largely hollowed out but still around. Early on his presidency was dominated by the slow recovery from the recession and later on he was locked out by Republican congress. I think this largely blunted what could have been a major progressive wave but again, history is just that. 

I understand where moderates come from. Generally speaking and sticking to a linear understanding of views (on the left-right spectrum), it makes sense for the sake of electability. Grab people from the middle and you can win. Additionally, moderate democrats have really been the only ones to win


I'm going to ignore Republicans for a minute because this is a discussion about where the Democratic party needs to go. For all intents and purposes it seems like the choices are between moderates and progressives and each has flame for the other; and I think each has its own flaws. But my biggest gripe is with the moderates as of now because my immediate response every time someone endorses moderate candidates is: what are you going to do? 

My entire political lifetime the Democratic party has been dominated by the moderate wing of the party and my entire political life I have received nothing of importance from the Government. What's more, their plans don't seem to endorse any change in policy either. They can hand wring all they want about progressives being childish and angry and not seeing the big picture (which by the way is a Trumpian tactic to avoid the actual policy issue), but at the end of the day I am still left asking what are you going to do? 

If we can at least agree that a huge problem at this time is cost of living, and at least assume that we all agree that elections and authoritarianism are bad, then what is the response? I don't see anything the moderate wing of the party endorses as bringing down the cost of living of not just the poor, but the working class and middle class. Housing is too expensive. Healthcare is too expensive. Childcare is too expensive. Moderates don't seem to have the fight to raise taxes or any resources what-so-ever to root out the main problem which is supply and demand. They can subsidize all the poorest people they want but the middle class is still as fucked. Tax breaks, tax cuts, industry subsidies, all of these play out at the margins but we are well past looking at the margins. 

The average cost to income for a house in this country has doubled in two decades. Healthcare, education, childcare, all have gone up well past the rate of inflation for decades and no amount of marginal solutions will bring about systemic change which is what I believe the people want right now. Again my question is: what are you going to do about it? Abundance seems to be a good step in the right direction, but again my read of that book is that it takes strong central government action to reform housing and transportation, but that's still only the tip of the iceberg. 

And
