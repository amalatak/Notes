### Lessons Learned
* Dill is kind of not worth it
	* Maybe do one harvest and dry?
* Cilantro is kind of not worth it
* Plant basil every month
	* Find late bolting kind
* Plant beans every few weeks
* Gherkins not worth it
	* Grow beans up trellis instead
* Rolling harvest of leafy greens worked well with squash idea
* Squash explodes at start of August with growth
* Fucking remember to plant the bush beans
* Fertilize more
* Consider leeks
* Onions a success
* Rotate the tomatoes
	* Strings need to be better supported
* Broccoli and kale did ok
	* Kale good, broccoli might not be worth it but it's good and the leaves are usable
	* If there's space, go ahead and try
* Melon didn't do well, maybe try again if there's space
* Root veggies - see how long they last, we never really eat them
* Maybe try potates in hard to grow area by raspberry and other places
	* Could also do those asian squash things, the white ones

Plant Bed Veggies
1. Tomatoes - solely tomatoes, 15 plants, rotate to front
2. Other nightshades
	1. Peppers
	2. Eggplant
	3. Tomatillos - got going really late
	4. Parsley did well here
3. Leafy greens - all need to be ripped out by late June, can't actually remember, maybe earlier
	1. Consider basil or beans to fill time between green harvest and squash power
	2. Spinach - short harvest
	3. Arugula - short harvest
	4. Butter lettuce - lasts a bit longer
	5. Beats - eh, if they last a while
	6. Carrots - do fine, no reason to stop
	7. Squash - will take over late season
4. The rest
	1. Onions did well
	2. Kale did well
	3. Broccoli did ok
	4. Didn't plant the fucking beans
	5. Potatoes, need to be rotated

### Future Ideas
Bean teepee: create a teepee of sticks and grow beans up it to make a little hideout, maybe for when we have kiddos
