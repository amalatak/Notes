# Overview

A vector is a mathematical representation of something that has magnitude and direction. Generally is a type of <b><u>tuple</u></b>, which is just an ordered list of elements. 

Vectors can be parameterized in a number of different coordinate spaces, be it all real numbers, complex, etc. For example
$$
\vec{v} \in \mathbb{R}^2
$$
The above would define some two-tuple, or vector in the real number coordinate space. 

To add vectors, simply add them. Subtracting them is similar. They must be the same dimension, and you might see something like $\vec{a}, \vec{b} \in \mathbb{R}^n$. Of note- if the order of subtraction is switched for two vectors the resulting vector is the negative such that
$$
\vec{v} - \vec{u} = \vec{t} \space \Rightarrow \space \vec{v} - \vec{u} = -\vec{t}
$$

## Unit Vectors

Unit vectors indicate the direction a vector is oriented. Often denoted with $\hat{i}, \hat{j}, \hat{k}$ corresponding to x, y, z, respectively. In simple terms,  
$$
\hat{i}, \hat{j} \in \mathbb{R}^2
$$
$$
\hat{i} = \begin{bmatrix}   
 1 \\
 0
\end{bmatrix},   
\hat{j} = \begin{bmatrix}   
 0 \\
 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$
For example, a vector, $\vec{v} \in \mathbb{R}^2$ could be described as 

$$
\vec{v} = 1\hat{i} -2\hat{j}
$$

Indicating it has 1 unit of _something_ in the x-direction, and -2 units in the y-direction.
