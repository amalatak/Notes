**Definition**
Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that studies vectors, matrices, and linear transformations.

**Vectors** 
A vector is a mathematical representation of something that has magnitude and direction. Generally is a type of **tuple**, which is just an ordered list of elements. 

Vectors can be parameterized in a number of different coordinate spaces, be it all real numbers, complex, etc. For example

$$
\vec{v} \in \mathbb{R}^2
$$

The above would define some two-tuple (vector) in the real number coordinate space. 

To add vectors, simply add them. Subtracting them is similar, but fun fact if vectors are subtracted in opposite directions the resulting vector is the opposite. They must be the same dimension. Might see something like $\vec{a}, \vec{b} \in \mathbb{R}^n$

# Unit Vectors

Unit vectors indicate the direction a vector is oriented. Often denoted with $\hat{i}, \hat{j}, \hat{k}$ corresponding to x, y, z, respectively. In simple terms,  

$$
\hat{i}, \hat{j} \in \mathbb{R}^2
$$

$$
\hat{i} = \begin{bmatrix}   
 1 \\
 0
\end{bmatrix},   
\hat{j} = \begin{bmatrix}   
 0 \\
 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

For example, a vector, $\vec{v} \in \mathbb{R}^2$ could be described as 

$$
\vec{v} = 1\hat{i} -2\hat{j}
$$

Indicating it has 1 unit of _something_ in the x-direction, and -2 units in the y-direction.
