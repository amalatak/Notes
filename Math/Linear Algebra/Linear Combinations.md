## Linear Combinations

A linear combination of vectors is an addition of vectors scaled by some constant
$$
for \space \vec{v_1}, \space \vec{v_2}...\vec{v_n} \in \mathbb{R^n}
\space and \space c_1, \space c_2...c_n \space \in \mathbb{R}
$$
A linear combination is as follows
$$
c_1\vec{v_1}+c_2\vec{v_2}+...+c_n\vec{v_n}
$$

## Spans 

The <b><u>span</u></b> of a vector indicates the possible linear combinations of any group of vectors. For example, $span(\vec{v_1}, \vec{v_2}) = \mathbb{R^2}$ would mean that the linear combination of those vectors could make any vector in the 2-dimensional real number plane. Not all spans cover all possibilities, two parallel vectors can only span along their line. Or the zero vector span is obviously zero, but for example $\hat{i}$, and $\hat{j}$ in classical coordinate systems can be linearly combined to make any vector in the 2-D plane. 
$$
Span(\vec{v_1}, \vec{v_2}...\vec{v_n}) = \left\{ c_1\vec{v_1}+c_2\vec{v_2}+...+c_n\vec{v_n} \vert c_i\in\mathbb{R} \space 1 \leq i \leq n \right\} 
$$
This definition simply states that the *span* of a set of vectors is simply another set of all possible linear scalar combinations of all vectors for all scalar values between 1 and n. 

NB: There are proofs for spans, if it comes up a lot add more notes here
