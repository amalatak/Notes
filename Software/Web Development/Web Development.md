# Ideas

### Recipe app
Create an application or website that allows me to
* Log in and out
* Upload recipes
* Filter based on 
	* main ingredient(s)
		* Fish
		* Chicken
		* Meat 
		* etc
	* Seasonality
	* Healthy
* Generate a grocery list for a weekly assembly of recipes
	* Maybe email them, that could be fun
### ISS Tracker
Simple ground tracking plot over a few passes, determine when to get epoch or TLE from NOAA and when to refresh plot. Create manual entry form for errors or if ISS is decommissioned. 

### Blog
Create a blog with posts that can be categorized and filtered by topic. Have suggested topics and pages at intro. Create login system to view all posts and public system for publicly viewable ones (e.g. keep politics and religion to myself). Default of posts should be private.
