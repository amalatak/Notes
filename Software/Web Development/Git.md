#versioncontrol

A version control tool can help maintain large complicated projects. Git is a command-line tool that we can use to 1) keep track of changes to software, 2) allow multiple people to work on a single application or piece of software and to sync the work, or 3) make changes to code without removing access to the original by branching and then merging into the main branch, and 4) we can revert back to older versions of code. 

Code is stored in a remote repository with changes uploaded from local changes (usually, changes can be made remote via certain interfaces). The changes can be pulled down by other local users. Conflicts between code can occur and be dealt with in simple ways.
