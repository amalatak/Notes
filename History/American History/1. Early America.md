## Early Overview

Early America is populated by Natives who crossed a land bridge from Asia, and due to the climate quickly spread to an extremely diverse set of regions and cultures. The Aztec and Inca built empires and at one time Tenochtitlan may have been the largest city in the world at its time. Given a time, such as 1200, Europe and the Americas may have looked more similar than one thinks. 

After the fall of Rome, Europe was a backwater ruled over by the Byzantine in the East and in the West by Roman remnants. It had backslid due to Religious (Christian and now Islam) change, and in-fighting in its former provinces. It was difficult to change things because it was difficult and expensive to import ideas and technology. The crusades changed this, and taught Europeans how to organize and gave them connections and routes with the Middle East and Far East. The lure of foreign treasure pulled at Europeans to explore and trade. Marco Polo went all the way to China in 1271 and stayed for 17 years, even filling government posts; then published his accounts. These early exploratory missions benefit Mediterranean cities and port city-states due to their location. 

The West was boxed out by those Mediterranean city-states and Islamic land routes to the East.

## Portugal and Spain

Western Europe was frustrated by Mediterranean city-state monopolies on trade and opted to go West. Portugal explored south and Vasco de Gama rounded the cape of good hope. The Spanish went West to try and find China and the Americas were initially a disappointment. Magellan went south around South America and found how large the Pacific was. When no northwest passage or Panama canal existed, the Americas were largely ignored and left to Conquistadores, such as Cortez with the Aztecs and Pizarro with the Inca looking for god, glory, and gold. 

Joanna of the Spanish Royals married into the Habsburgs, who controlled Austria and all of German speaking states (united in the Holy Roman Empire). Joanna's son Charles inherited all of this, the most land since Charlemagne. But there were issues, German states were restless, Martin Luther had launched the protestant reformation with his protests against Catholic corruption, splitting the continent. 

The Spanish freebooters toppled American empires, enslaved the Natives, and slaughtered their populations with guns, germs (which eventually killed a majority of the natives), and steel. The crown didn't care so long as they got their cut, but it did care about "nobodies" claiming to be aristocrats. Then they setup their own structures of formal government to rule with organization as would have been in Spain, and they set up missions to convert the natives and granted Encomendieros to great haciendas to force Indians into labor. They enslaved, dislocated, and confronted the Natives to do all of this; and eventually this went from an extraction to a settler society. 

Spain was initially vastly successful into the 16th and 17th centuries with this new wealth but it, and a few other things like Dutch independence fighting and foreign gold shipping looting, eventually crippled their economy and so their exploration funds, making room for others to explore. 

## France

France emerged from a bloody civil war between Catholics and Protestants in the 16th century (1580s-1590s) to become a power by the 17th. In the late 16th century they explored Quebec and parts of the Gulf, but never really established a settler society and became caught up in that civil war. After which they did establish a permanent settlement in Quebec, but France was mostly distracted with trying to conquer Europe, draining their coffers. They were more focused on extraction and (failing to) convert the natives; they actually forbade religious dissidents (amidst all the religious chaos) from emigrating, fearing them being too unruly in a concentration, essentially shooting themselves in the foot of significant settlers. 

They did find fur though, and they beefed with the Iroquois (five nations, major fur traders) and befriended Algonquin. The Iroquois blocked French fur trading from the South so they eventually went west to the Mississippi headwaters and eventually down to the Gulf, setting up forts all along the river. 

## The Netherlands

The Dutch came out from under the thumb of the Spanish in the 17th century, and with terrible land used their experience with the sea to establish shipping, then maritime insurance, and eventually set themselves up as bankers of Europe. The Dutch East India company was organized to find the northwest passage to the Pacific by Hudson, but instead established the New Netherlands and New Amsterdam to trade fur. 

They traded furs with the Iroquois. They set up grids for the cities, and didn't care what anyone really did as long as it was profitable. They even let women own property. This settlement was never a commercial or settler success, however. 

## England

England came to the party late, in part due to nonsense done by Henry VIII and fallout from the protestant reformation; his son Edward enforces Protestantism, Mary backtracks and brutally enforces Catholicism, then Elizabeth settles it with Protestantism and only after she's on the throne for 20 years do things get moving. 

The earliest settlements in North America were for the growing raiding of Catholic Spanish ships. A settlement is created in Roanoke twice, but after a Spanish armada fails to invade England the settlement is ignored to deal with it and disappeared by the time they returned. This failure underscores how difficult and expensive settlements are. 

With the protestant shift, new finance laws allow easier corporations. One new charter is a joint-stock Virginia Company, which sets up in Maine (thinking the climate would be similar), and at Jamestown in the Chesapeake (thinking Mediterranean climate) around 1620, but never yielded anything. It lacked vision, and the men thought the settlement was for raiding but were never supplied as such, and it only limped on through draconian rule. Eventually it was crippled by Powhatan tribes, bankrupting the Virginia company. 

King James revoked the charter and took direct control of the settlement, but only legally. They ignored the settlement and gave them nothing and the governor nothing, leading to the settlement creating its own government (the House of Burgesses) to collect their own tax money, and establishing the principle of benign neglect. England mostly ignored settlements, and this lead to the settlements being dominated by England's rejected or unwanted. All citizens were required to be members of the Church of England, so Catholics could leave and practice freely such as in (eventually, after a failure at Avalon in Newfoundland) Maryland. In truth, Elizabeth and her successor James were more "don't ask, don't tell", but the benign neglect was still appealing. 

It also allowed for them to setup their own local governments if not still unrecognized. James was succeeded by Charles I, who sucked and Parliament overthrew him and briefly converted to a Republic until 1660 when they recalled his son as King to revert. This gave certain groups a taste of Republicanism and kind of ruined the belief Monarchy was handed down from God. 

Some radicals obtained a charter to set out a political experiment colony; Carolina setup with input from John Locke on a new social and government structure with popular input and certain tolerance (kind of a limited Oligarchy). Georgia began as some kind of benevolent poor or debtor colony. 

The southern settlements started as social experiments but eventually became commercially successful agricultural ventures. They abandoned indentured servitude for full on black slavery to mark slaves as that. Eventually these economies grew to be so successful that the crown had to regulate them economically, leading to Bacon's rebellion against taxes and falling prices, which showed that total neglect wouldn't do (the crown actually directly got involved), and accelerated the shift towards chattel slavery. 

In addition, Carolina planters eventually overthrow their leaders and offer it to the crown for free. Georgia's poor overthrow the trustees and surrender to the crown as well. 

## New England

Radical protestants, puritans, were too extreme for the Church of England and much like Catholics were persecuted. To them, the Church of England looked and practiced too much like a Catholic church; and they split into three categories: reformists, Presbyterians (who wanted to abolish bishops) and separatists- which was seen as cultural treason. Catholics threatened Elizabeth early on, but she gave no short shrift to these radicals either. They fled demands for conformity to setup their own Calvinist Churches. 

Calvinism taught total dominion of God over everything, including human destiny and that humans were morally helpless; god would have to forgive original sin on his own; and if God was totally sovereign, Kings were not. If a king conflicted with God, it was the latter who was absolute and any punishment for this was seen as a test of faith. 

The pilgrims, a group of radical separatists, were the first to go. But Charles I pursued puritans with a special venom and soon others followed, at first in a less absolute sense. A group founded Massachusetts as a joint stock company, ostensibly as Englishmen and set up a de facto government in Boston. 

Puritans proved to be an unruly bunch, spreading all over New England and in ways the governor of Mass. couldn't control. Rhode Island was founded by a group of separatists who were banished from MA, but slowly many MA churches drifted that way. 

New England, as a settlement society, eventually grew wealthier, more unequal, less socially pure, and desire for land for new people led to conflicts with Natives over land and trading, namely the King Phillip rebellion. Since Calvinism was voluntary, initial puritans were quite extreme. Eventually though successive generations weren't so radical and a sense of "kids these days" manifested. The Indian conflicts presented a "wrath of God" sentiment for the lack of vigor and the Jeremiad revival ensued in response, setting the pattern of cultural revival following conflict.

The Swedes actually had a small settlement in Delaware. In the 1500s they latched themselves onto the protestant reformation and had a successful iron industry that gave them power to found a north American extraction settlement for fur. It was swallowed up by the Dutch after the 30 years war. This was taken easily by the British after they eclipsed the Dutch. 

The English try and regulate dutch shipping from cutting into their own shipping industry since the dutch could undercut. Charles II eventually launches a war over this and the English take Dutch N. America. The N. American part was sponsored by the King's brother, the Duke of York, who leaves tolerance and the land system in place. The Dutch people remain and aren't supper happy, there's a rebellion at some point; but other than that not much happens until William Penn.

In 1642, Charles I provokes civil war, who has the army and foreign allies. Parliament has the King's enemy: puritans. Parliament wins and lops of Charles I's head. The alliance between puritans and parliament doesn't last long with old puritan grievances about too little zeal for reform resurfaced and the parliamentary army lead by Cromwell turned on Parliament. He took over and England religious life fractured into many Protestant sects demanding lands divided up. One sect was Quakers, who are kind of quirky religious extremists, who "Quake" only to God (didn't remove their hats in Church or something) and wanted to take messages directly from God. 

Once Cromwell dies, England invites the crown back to Charles II. This restores the Church of England, wiping out the remaining radical sects. Only Quakers survive since they are absolute pacifists, and authorities left them alone. In 1667, William Penn, an aristocrat, converts to Quakerism and, with several other Quakers acquires a charter to N. New Jersey area. Then he uses connections to acquire a charter along the Delaware from Charles II with absolute rights as proprietor for political control of the land and leaves for N. America. 

Pennsylvania fell from its Quaker ideals rapidly to the dismay of the Quakers; however, it's core ideology of tolerance and rejection of slavery remained, and it became a hub of commerce instead of hub for religion. 

## Early Economy

The first people in the new world were unskilled, unwanted or unemployed. They died often, land was cheap, and labor was expensive. Eventually, these people formed unofficial governments that passed taxes, formed militias, etc, and by the 1700s were beginning to stabilize. 

In England, half the people without land were seen as... dragging down society, and so early on joint stock ventures could buy out prison sentences as temporary forced labor. Land was cheap, but labor was expensive. Soon indentures became common. England never sent anyone because that cost money and also the colonies were starting to compete. 

Eventually as people lived longer and cheap land filled up, indentures got more expensive to deal with. Their terms were extended and they were punished with longer terms. In VA, only landowners were made allowed to vote. Forts were built to keep Indians out- and settlers in. Eventually, Bacon's rebellion over conditions facing poor, slaves, and indentures lead to increased focus on race-based slavery.

The landowners turned to the Dutch, Portuguese, and Spanish slavers. Black slaves were easy to identify as well in contrast with White or Native; and at the time they were living longer. They also began a campaign to justify such slavery based in racial inferiority. The forced migration of black Africans even outnumbered European immigration. The early American economy was almost entirely based off forced, chattel slavery and colonies that ignored it slid to backwaters. 

## Early Culture

Mostly defined by folk culture (local goods e.g. blankets), urban culture (sale of goods in wider area), and elite (skilled crafts e.g. paintings), early Americans didn't have much. They even idealized European culture and considered "making it" if artists made it in England. 

Philosophy was different. Early on Aristotle was the definite word, but that quickly changed with the advent of new "logic" Enlightenment thinking from Isaac Newton or John Locke. Generally Americans adapted, totally accepted, or rejected the new philosophy with most adapting. 

## The Great Awakening

(Kind of just a note) When Charles II died, his brother (duke of York), James succeeded him. He was eventually chased out in the glorious revolution, but not before he reorganized the colonies, including sending a new governor who was then promptly imprisoned. This established that Americans didn't like change. 

Colonial identity changes did trigger other reactions, such as Salem Witch Trials in the late 1600s. But in the 1740s, the colonies altogether mostly went through a large-scale religious revival, and many institutions were founded as a result. It was the first major cultural event and resulted in printing patterns and democratizing public discourse, also empowering non-elites to setup their own standards and values apart from their superiors. It setup a pattern of cultural renewal in times of crisis.
