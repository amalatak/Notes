The war left a few questions
* What to do with the rebel states
* What to do with the remaining freed slaves

From 1865 to 1877 reconstruction answered these. Also the end of the war did not end the bitterness between North and South. 
## Early Years and Planning

No one was sure what price would they have to pay and who in the North would control the process: President, Congress, moderate, radical, etc. 

Lincoln wanted to make it easy and promised a pardon to all who pled allegance to the U.S. and it's laws (including emancipation and except for certain leaders and diplomats), and that when enough people did this (10%) Southern states could form a government that also did the same. Only slave property was confiscated and states would have full Union membership. It did, however, plan to leave social system in tact enabling Blacks and Whites to gradually change. 

Radicals wanted land for freed slaves to make a living and that 10% was too low, and they wanted huge property seizures from rebel scum. Lincoln argued that reconstruction was a simple process for loyal citizens to regain control. 

Radicals also wanted blacks to be given the vote, otherwise they only would have quasi-freedom, especially black veterans. Louisiana and Arkansas met Lincolns criteria but Congress didn't accept their government or representatives. 

Congress came up with the Wade-Davis bill. It called for 50% allegiance, and only those that took an iron-clad oath could participate in conventions. Lincoln killed this bill, and Congress issued a manifesto in response attacking him. He treated the AK and LA governments as states, but moved closer to radicals just prior to assassination. 

## Johnson vs Congress

Johnson took office closer to the radicals and hated the plantation aristocracy, but quickly mellowed. They settled on repudiation of secession, acknowledgement and freedom of emancipated slaves, guarantee of political rights of unionists and excommunication of certain rebels. 

Gradually Johnson moved more conservative, he was intensely racist. He like Lincoln thought he should decide reconstruction and in 1865 offered amnesty to anyone who took an oath of allegiance except for certain persons. He outlined a process for whites to set up governments if they abolished slavery, nullified secession, and repudiated war debts. The freedman bureau setup to help transition blacks, but was incapable to protect them usually. 

Before the next (very republican) congress took office, southern states took advantage of Johnson's leniency. Some states refused to repudiate secession, elected confederates to high office, refused to ratify the 13th amendment, enacted black codes restricting freedom of blacks, and talked about states rights. Mississippi setup a militia with a bunch of ex-confederates. Johnson pardoned a shit load of people including planters. Johnson began to see southern democrats as his allies. 

Conservative republicans even deplored this. The congress that met soon after then denied newly elected southern congressman seats. In 1866 there was a crisis: moderate republicans dominated but they all agreed that the Johnson southern congressman shouldn't be seated. They wanted black protection at a minimum in the South. Moderates and conservatives wanted to deal with Johnson, radicals wanted to take control. 

A joint reconstruction committee dominated by moderates called for: extending the life of the freedman's bureau, define freedman civil rights and giving courts power to hear appeals from blacks from state court action. Johnson vetoed both of these. The 1866 civil rights bill called blacks citizens, nullified black codes, and gave legal and property rights to freed blacks (notably not black vote). Johnson vetoed this as well (both on the grounds of lack of southern representation). This moved many republicans more radical. 

## Republican Victories

Congress then passed both bills over Johnson's veto and then wrote an amendment to serve as a basis for readmitting states to the union: the 14th amendment; all native born Americans including blacks were citizens, prohibit states from denying any person life, liberty, or property without due process guaranteeing equal protection under the law, and prohibited confederates from serving in the government. It was implied that any state ratifying this amendment would be accepted back into the union. No vote for black men yet, even in many Northern states. 

Johnson called the amendment unconstitutional (same grounds), and setup a conservative party in opposition but his top-heavy democrat party mostly failed; he attacked too many moderates. Republicans "waved the bloody shirt" (for actually most of the rest of the century), reminding Northerners that democrats had led the rebellion. 

Republicans crushed the midterms of 1866. 

## Congress Takes Control

After the midterms congress aimed to pass the 14th amendment and needed 3/4 of all the states, of which Johnson pressured them not to sign. Johnson's and the South's intransigence lead many moderate republicans to side with radicals. They began to push for Black suffrage to pass their agenda.

In 1867 congress overrode Johnson vetoes to pass bills nullifying all state governments except for Tennessee (which ratified the 14th) and divided the south into 5 military districts imposing military rule. States could only be admitted if they accepted black suffrage and ratified the 14th amendment. They enrolled black voters in the military and excluded a bunch of white voters. They limited Johnson's ability to remove officials, especially Lincolns old appointments, and limited the president's control over the army. 

Carpetbaggers (Northern whites) and scallywags (Southern whites) began to form a southern republican party. Majority of white southerners stayed away believing it a party of blacks and looking to Johnson whose position eroded.

In the end congress moved to impeach him, they couldn't find anything to convict him until he removed secretary of war and some hardline generals without approval. The trial was a huge event, and he was acquitted by 1 vote. A few republicans voted to acquit to avoid precedent, and because Johnson pledged to enforce the reconstruction acts. Also probably a few didn't want the radical guy who would replace him to actually do this.

Johnson was a good boy after that and finished out his term. In the meantime reconstruction resumed and states made new, forward looking constitutions. 

## Grant

In 1868 Republicans nominated Grant and Democrats nominated someone who wanted a return to white supremacy. Southern whites and the KKK intimidated republicans and killings occurred in Louisiana.

In the end Grant won propelled by black votes in the south. The 15th amendment was passed because it was right but also because it helped Republicans. This was considered the end of reconstruction by many in the North, while southern whites chafed over their rule.  

## Southern Reaction

The view in the south was that illiterate blacks and carpetbaggers and scalawag allies held white southerners under their thumb. They held a lost cause belief that the south had fought a righteous fight for states rights and other things (see birth of a nation or gone with the wind). 

This was very wrong, where in the south blacks held 10-15% of state offices at the height of reconstruction and few house and senate seats. No black governors. They made up 80% of southern republicans but the party was dominated by whites. 

The southern republican party was the subject of intensely racist attacks, and soon social pressure pushed out whites and divisions fractured the party as states returned to white democrat rule. Additionally, republicans built infrastructure and funded schools and southerners didn't like paying for it (via taxes). The KKK terrorized republicans and in 1871 there was a federal law to enact martial law where the KKK was doing so. 

Soon there was a realignment. Rumors of Republican corruption in the white house (not actual Grant) and northern empathy for southern whites lead to a movement to unseat Grant. They called themselves liberal republicans and called for merit based civil service, withdrawal of military forces from the South, return to white democrat rule, and for amnesty for ex-confederates. 

Together with Democrats in the 1872 election they nominated Horace Greeley. The election, on state reconciliation, was easily won by Grant. However, Republican position was not as strong as may have been indicated. Southern republican corruption was hurting the parties reputation and liberating slaves had never been popular. The panic of 1873 also hurt their image. Their momentum was waning and democrats won the House in the midterms. 

In 1875 democrats enacted the Mississippi plan, to apply pressure to Republican whites and to brutally intimidate black voters. They orchestrated riots at black gatherings. It worked in the south and democrats began to win back states. 

In 1876, Republican Hayes won very narrowly in a very contested election. There was a deal for Hayes to engage in southern development, appoint southerners, let the remaining state governments resume operations as long as they gave blacks some rights (they didn't), ending reconstruction.

In some ways it was a failure, given the black experience in the following decades but the 13-15 amendments did pass.
## Meanwhile
Wars against Natives happened, industrialization, labor unrest in the North, another financial panic, a railroad, etc.
