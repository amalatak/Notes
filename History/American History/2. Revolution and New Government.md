## Colonial Involvement and War

After so much benign-neglect, at the end of the 1600s the British attempted to reintegrate the colonial economy through regulation. They based their economic (and to an extent political) belief on mercantilism, a philosophy of fixed wealth; and by extension they either traded or took resources from others to build wealth (and to an extent power). The French actually pioneered this idea and recommended three things: fix the taxes and levy them on real sources of wealth like land, tariff English and Dutch imports and subsidize French exports to make them dependent on France, organize colonies to serve the home country (require them to buy products from home country, shut down competing industries with mother country, use only mother country shipping). When all else fails, do war and make colonies carry out that warfare as well. 

The English figured out these new rules soon. At home they lowered taxes on grain, banned French wine, created a bank of England, and united with Scotland in 1707. Soon after, the navigation acts were passed, forbidding shipping to England in anything but English ships. Then to anyone else in anything but English ships. Then certain products could only go to England. Then all shipping had to go to England first. 

The first blows were dulled. Originally, enforcement was difficult: smuggling was easy and bribery was cheap. Mercantilism had some benefits to Americans as well, e.g. American ships *were* English ships. 

Tensions were growing between the British and French. Settlements eventually started to cross into each others territory. The French built barrier forts in Ohio through Virginia company territorial claims. Virginia militia are sent to stop one fort being built but they're too late and surrender. 

After a series of conflicts, war ballooned in the seven years (or French and Indian) war over colonial trading rights in the St. Lawrence. The French, with few settlers to require land thus reducing (but not eliminating) conflict with Indians, were more successful in motivating the Indians to attack the English, but failed with their actual settlements in North America due to those very myopic immigration rules restricting their immigration; whereas the British successfully deployed theirs in North America to drive the French from the Ohio river valley. After initial failures, William Pitt is appointed Prime Minister, appoints new generals in N. America, and the British eventually won. France ceded all Canada and everything east of the Mississippi to the British in the Treaty of Paris, ending their North American empire. 

## Rejection of Empire

Following the war the British celebrations were short. They were broke (already heavily taxed) and undergoing civil upheaval around absolutism (which paired well with Mercantilism) in Monarchy; over beliefs that all power rested in the King, which the Stuarts pursued. There had been two civil wars, one from the puritans to overthrow Charles I and then from parliament to overthrow James II. They were split into the Whigs and the Torys. 

Whigs believed in rural communities and strict Protestantism. Distilled into four propositions: liberty is natural and all people are born with natural rights; people give up a small amount of liberty and property to create governments and property to protect and carry out that liberty; liberty can be destroyed (usually by a corrupt political elite) and governments that descend into corruption should be changed; liberty must make an alliance with virtue (moral or religious) to resist the allure of power. Not all, but Radical Whigs wanted to get rid of the Monarchy. 

Mercantilist PM Grenville and Parliament resolved to tax the colonialists, with a *direct* tax. They insisted the colonies were plantations and compelled them to support a permanent military garrison. They imposed a tax on papers, the Stamp Act in 1765. This triggered colonial outrage over their treatment as a plantation, where they had considered themselves self-governed and their legislatures stepped on. Parliament had never bypassed colonial legislatures and meddle in colonial internal affairs with a direct tax. They had no representatives in Parliament.

Two responses: Stamp Act Congress formed of 9/13 and issued a declaration of rights and grievances and stated that they could only be taxed by their own representatives; a mob attacked some government official houses and spurred on by the Sons of Liberty, others conducted demonstrations. The North American English government collapsed and the succeeding one repealed the act.  

Americans were spurred on by Whig political writings of liberty and local governments and that fear that the British elite would simply take whatever involvement they wanted, including establishing a Church of England. 

The next set of taxes were the (supposedly more gentle) Townsend Act taxes, taxing paper, glass, and tea. They caused similar rebellions about self-government. This time the British responded less kindly to American rejections, eventually culminating in the Boston Massacre. The next government suspended those taxes except the tax on Tea. This stepped back outrage but didn't get rid of it, until they implemented a Tea Act (actually designed to lower the price of tea from India). The Sons of Liberty responded with threats of tar and feathering and eventually the Boston Tea Party, the first act of direct destruction.

In response, Parliament implemented the Intolerable Acts, directly taking over Massachusetts government and closing the port of Boston. Massachusetts responded with the Suffolk resolves, a declaration of resistance including refusal to pay taxes and a boycott of British goods; they sent these to other colonies. Virginia and Massachusetts called for a congress and the first continental congress (12/13) was called in Philly in 1774. They adopted the resolves and agreed to a second congress in 1775. In a suppression attempt, the British seized military stores and attempted to raid Lexington and Concord in pursuit of John Hancock and Sam Adams (Paul Revere rode to warn the towns here), ending in a battle between the British and militia troops. 

## The revolution

Despite the incident at Lexington and Concord, it could have been just that, but the British response spurred on the radicals. Despite all of the high-talking, a lot of people had second thoughts and the loyalists feared independence most, all other colonies (and GA) weren't even at the congress. Congress only cared about their own state interests and most people still just wanted to make a buck; they were split into loyalists and patriots/radicals. Britain organized this split; Gauge cleared Bunker Hill of American Militia (could sell them another hill at the same price); Congress authorized a continental army, and the seizure of fort Ticonderoga. Parliament approved the American Prohibitory Bill, blockading America, declaring them in rebellion, and hired German mercenaries to fill posts. 

The second continental congress formed with more radicals and fewer loyalists this time, and sanctioned the Massachusetts government as legitimate, and soon the sanction of all other colonial governments. The congress moved to take up independence and Jefferson wrote the Declaration. A government was organized under a colonial constitution to solicit aide from European states. But Dickinson's Articles of Confederation were too weak. Franklin and John Adams went to France, Spain, and The Netherlands to solicit aide but only would France aid them, and when there was proof they could succeed on their own.

## The War

Washington was appointed to head the Continental Army with limited resources, little planning, and few officers. Still, they persisted and seized siege guns from Ticonderoga to protect Boston. Early on, however, things didn't go well, and Washington suffered many raids on the coast and early defeats in Long Island, New Jersey, across the Delaware to Valley Forge, and even lost Philadelphia where the government scattered west; and their weird expedition to Canada failed.  

The British, however, weren't great. They were spread thin, generals subject to the purchase system (which did seem to help with loyalty to the crown). The British plan to cutoff New England failed as Howe went to Philly and the other two armies were stopped, namely at Saratoga. Failure to clinch victory opened up (failed) diplomatic attempts, which Americans took as weakness. 

Following Saratoga, the French supplied the Americans as allies sending arms, money, mercenaries (and training), guarantees of liberty, and distractions for the British Navy. The British had to rethink things, and sent most of their effort to attacking the French in the West Indies, resolving to raid the North American coast from NYC without a real campaign, and leaving Philadelphia. At one point even Spain got involved. To maintain pressure, they launched invasions of the colonial south and even took Charleston (where loyalists got some revenge on continentals). Clinton's raids were quite brutal and he bribed Indians to harass Americans and offered freedom to slaves. The ease of that conquest and harassment lead to costly mistakes attempting to invade further inland in North Carolina; they were overextended. (Clinton bribes Benedict Arnold at this point)

Cornwallis attempted to setup a base in Wilmington to get Ocean reinforcements, but was boxed in by the Americans (Nathaniel Green had brilliant tactics in the campaign) and French, and after attempting to strike north into Virginia was surrounded at his new base at Yorktown, effectively eliminating the last British threat. The remaining British troops were not in a position to attack and the government in London was not prepared to give more troops. The war was costly in both monetary and economic terms with loss of trade. Parliament voted to end the war. 

The Treaty of Paris (1783) recognized American independence with the colonies being conceded legal existence and all British land west of the Appalachians was ceded. The victory, however, came at a cost as many slaves and indentured servants deserted to fight with the British, the economy was in ruinous inflation, and shipping was hit hard and lost its British protection. 

Old colonial elites were exiled, loyalists were imprisoned, and new constitutions and governments were organized in the states. Franklin wanted Canada, but that went nowhere, and many officers wanted to end Congressional intervention and make Washington King, but Washington resigned from the Army and retired to Mount Vernon, setting an example and saving the Republic.  

## The Constitution

The US was fucked after the war by inflation. Lenders to the government saw their loans evaporate in inflation. In 1786 Shays rebellion protested Ma. taxes, and in Virginia's westernmost areas there was an attempt to form a new state. A new generation was seeing the nation and not states as the source of authority by 1785, especially Hamilton. Finally, a conflict over river navigation rights between MD and VA called for a convention to write a new constitution. This, coupled with Shays and a fear of a weak government being incapable of suppressing revolution led to a convention in 1787. 

The new constitution let the government tax the states and external commerce, issue money, and maintain a standing army. The great compromise lead to the current form of legislature we have. The president was powerful, commanding the armed forces, overseeing foreign affairs, and executing the law, and only allowed to be so due to the electoral college and Washington being the obvious choice.  

There were some sharp omissions- no political parties mentioned, supremacy of the federal government over the states was only implied, and no standard of citizenship. 

Discussions over the constitution split into Federalists in support and anti-federalists against. Hamilton, Madison, and Jay, took part in propaganda, writing the federalist papers. It worked, and with the promise of a Bill of Rights and to not meddle in state affairs too much (cough- slavery), it was ratified (especially by NY and VA). 

Deep scars ran between conflicts over how to resolve the debt. Hamilton won the day with the US assuming all state debt and creating a national bank, but it was not auspicious. Federalists were the party in support of the strong Federal government leaving the others to be labeled as "anti-federalists". 

Hamilton was one of these who thought the Federal government should 

The first business of the first congress was to pass the first Amendments in the Bill of Rights:
* No state church
* Free speech and press
* No restrictions on militias
* No search and seizure
* No quartering troops
* Everything not explicitly delegated or prohibited are reserved for states or people

Still, some liberties were taken. Congress authorized Washington to create heads and new departments: State (Jefferson), War (Knox), Treasury (Hamilton), Attorney General. There was also a new Judicial system, which had little spelled out in the constitution.
