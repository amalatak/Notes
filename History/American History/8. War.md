## Firing on Fort Sumter 

When Lincoln took office, the 7 states had seceded and setup a government and capital in Montgomery. Prevailing opinion at the time was to coerce the south back into the Union, especially for economic reasons. Lincoln reiterated support for leaving slavery alone where it was and supported an amendment as such, but that he wouldn't compromise on expansion to territories. He also condemned secession and emphasized that the US would hold all of its property, but he wasn't going to start anything. 

Sumter was in Charleston and SC was demanding it to turn over. Canons were aimed at it and it was low on supplies. Buchanan had authorized a failed supply mission. But now it was desperate and Lincoln attempted to resupply, very gently by notifying everyone. Davis' advisors called it hostile and Davis decided to demand capitulation otherwise they would fire; and so they fired. 

The Fort was surrendered and galvanized both sides. Lincoln called for 75k volunteers, prompting four more upper south states to secede including Virginia and their capital moved to Richmond.

## Fighting

Either side could have won the war. The North was far more populous and economically powerful. All the South needed was a tie and the war would be fought in their home ground. Neither side had a real standing army. 

Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson would lead the South, and Grant and Sherman would lead the North. Both sides had very capable leadership trained at West Point and experienced in the Mexican-American war, but the North generally had deeper ranks among generalship. 

Early on, as always, many people think the war will be short. 

1863, after Gettysburg, Vicksburg, and Chattanooga is often seen as having sealed the fate of the South. 

After Grant's victories he's promoted to a rank not seen since Washington and takes command against Lee. His plan was to use massive pressure everywhere to stretch the confederates thin with two major offensives: grant leading in N. VA and Sherman taking Atlanta and then scorching the interior. It was partly to make war seem as terrible as possible but also to kill confederate production instead of men. 

These two campaigns drag on longer than expected leading to low northern morale in the middle of 1864 over whether they would want to continue. Grant was doing his plan, the armies were in constant contact, but there were no major victories; but in the Fall finally Atlanta fell, the port of mobile was closed, and major victories in the Shenandoah valley. Lincoln won the election and it became obvious the war would continue.

After Atlanta, Sherman does his march to the sea with total warfare destroying everything, after which he turned north and scorched the Carolinas. 

Eventually Grant pushed Lee back and captured Richmond in April. Finally Lee asked for terms and surrendered at Appomattox under generous terms. There were more surrenderings to come but this was considered the end of the war. 
#### East

The war in the East (East of Appalachia) was, early on, disastrous for the North. The two capitals were just 100 miles apart and so fighting as fierce. Lee won initial victories (making everyone realize this could drag on), and pushed back about every wave of invasion early on, but still Lee never had success in Northern territory. Lincoln would, especially early on in this theatre, run through generals in frustration. 

Into 1862 Lee hoped to help Democrats in the North and coerce border states, supply his army in the North, keep the initiative, and to coerce Europe to his side; that campaign crested at his push-back at Antietam, but the US failed to tactically follow up with this victory. 

1863 was difficult for the North, two Northern campaigns were crushed by Lee's army at Fredericksburg and at Chancellorsville. Lee achieved basically god-like status. He poked into Pennsylvania, but then lost at Gettysburg (again failure to follow up) where Lincoln gave his famous speech. 
#### West

The west (of Appalachia) was generally more successful for the North. Hallock put Grant and Sherman in charge of TN, who then moved down the MI river to cut the south in half. New Orleans fell. It wasn't easy though, including at one point the South launched a counter-attack to regain much of and to coerce Kentucky but was rebuffed. Eventually they succeeded at Vicksburg as part of the Anaconda plan in 1863, cutting the South in half. Grant pushed on to Chattanooga to relieve a siege, winning a huge victory. This makes Grant the unequivocal go-to general and completes major tactical maneuvers to take the MI river and Tennessee.  
## Homefront

#### Politics

Lincoln could not lose the upper south and took great pains to avoid triggering them. They had large populations. Kentucky was bordered by the OH river and was heavily divided but ended up remaining and Lincoln refrained from sending troops there early on. Missouri (already kind of involved from Kansas and pro-slave border ruffians) was also divided and engaged in bitter guerilla warfare with lynchings, bushwackings, etc. Maryland was the most dramatic, since that was where the US capitol was and Lincoln took great, even unconstitutional measures to ensure it remained in the Union: arresting pro-south legislators and blocking anti-union men from voting. Delaware was never seriously going to secede, and West Virginia split off from Virginia to join the Union. 

After Antietam, Lincoln issued a preliminary emancipation proclamation making the US officially opposed to slavery. This pissed off some Northerners who didn't want to fight for blacks, but it made it very difficult for Europe to back the South; the British had come very close to attempting to mediate. 

In the trough of 1863, both sides experienced turmoil at home. Both sides had engaged in conscription, in the North many opposed emancipation (they would fight for the Union but not blacks), Copperheads (anti-Lincoln democrats) were anti-war. The South had shortages and bread riots. Neither side was, however, totally deterred.

The North kept elections and two parties, while the South shunned the system; they felt they needed to remain united for independence and wanted to return to the system of the founders. However, normal fissures quickly showed. States' rights advocates clashed with war policy. Further, their congress was kind of inept and while Davis was fairly skilled he was no Lincoln and lost touch with Southern people. Much of their faction/party structure revolved around Davis-anti-Davis lines. 

The south, with strife and destruction, experienced something that was new to the US and it's a good question why it actually didn't collapse sooner. The North was wildly different where the war hardly touched it, where its economy prospered. 

The Republicans consolidated power and had conservatives, moderates, and radicals but they all generally voted together against Democrats. The radicals, favoring harshly executing the war, gained power as the war went on. Lincoln moved closer to radicals too especially on emancipations. The Democrats were split between pro-war and anti-war (favored lenient piece "copperheads") parties. Copperheads were most popular in the southern Midwest and Irish Catholics. The Democratic party detested blacks, abolitionists, and temperance advocates who supported Republicans and didn't want to fight for freedom instead for the union. 

1864 was crucial, the war was going poorly early in the year and Lincoln expected to be defeated. But between nomination and election the US won a series of critical victories propelling Republicans to victory, propelling the war to an end for Union and for freedom. The election was a testament to democracy that it happened during the war and soldiers were allowed to vote even if that meant voting for candidates to shorten the war. The confederates had hoped the Democrats would win and were very disheartened when Lincoln won.

Lincoln was assassinated a few days after the war by a famous actor. 
#### Economy

The Southern economy and it's people lived the war more than the North. As the North raged into southern areas, it disrupted their factories and many southerners became refugees in their own country, especially in the upper south (of course they were seen as a burden). Many were weary of the war as it dragged on, but still they maintained allegiance. 

The Southern economy was also hindered by transportation, able to produce enough generally but not able to move it around, leading to shortages and inflation, which lead to food riots and letters from wives to desert. Many hid goods from the government who impressed them, and some governors subverted the government allowing state militia service.  

The Northern economy boomed during the war with demand for war materials more than filling the gap of lost southern trade and agriculture did very well, too despite labor off fighting due to technology and canning. Transportation expanded and got better while it was falling apart in the South. This contrast in economies would continue for decades after the war.

The war allowed Republicans to enact most of their goals for capitalist growth including national banking (with a national currency), a homestead act to give away federal land, a grant of land to states for colleges, a railroad act for the transcontinental railroad (and a shit load of railroad came from that).

The North ended the war with an intense sense of optimism, having won and passed all that legislation and growth at the same time, while the south was demoralized and an economic failure. After the halfway point, the home fronts diverged in experience significantly. 
#### The Draft

Supplying the armies was a huge undertaking. Finding enough people to fight wasn't easy. The confederacy saw a large rush of men early on, but only enlisted for 12 months and so they created conscription (even keeping back volunteers by extension). Worth noting there had never been conscription in the US; also that the "states-rights" confederacy engaged in conscription first. The Confederacy saw many draft-dodgers, but mobilized 80% of it's eligible white men, only possible due to slavery. 

The Union mobilized about half, with a bunch of immigrants and blacks, and had more volunteers but, too, implemented a draft. In the North you could pay someone else to serve for you or a commutation fee to remove yourself from the draft (the poors didn't like this). There were NYC riots after Gettysburg. It started as anti-draft but turned into a race-riot. Many Northerners fled to Canada.  In the end the draft operated to encourage enlistment; men could even be paid a bounty to agree to enlist. 

The draft ended up making up a small percentage of forces, and the armies were a good cross-section of populations. Slave-owners were overrepresented in the Southern army. Although a perception, it wasn't really a rich v. poor war.  

#### Funds

Each side used paper money, loans, and taxes. By the end of the war, the paper money was virtually worthless by inflation due to blockades, Northern occupation of Southern territory, transportation network breakdown, and just a shitty agricultural economy.

The US used stable greenback currency, backed as legal-tender (could be used for all debts). Most of the money came from loans via bonds bought by civilians, tying common people to the national cause. The robust economy worked much better.

Both sides supplied their armies well with rifle-muskets. The US had repeating weapons and produced better ordinance (Southern rounds even exploded prematurely). Lees army often went off poorer supplies and meals. The overall theme is that both had enough, the South just lagged in almost every way and the civil war begins the US pattern of being extremely well supplied in conflicts.

After the war, southern sympathizers try and paint a picture of David v. Goliath regarding supplies but it really wasn't true. Actually the South did remarkably well building a war-economy given its agricultural status. 

## The Black Experience During the War

This was a profound period of change for African Americans. Many abolitionists wanted to fight for emancipation but Lincoln wanted to walk a line since many Northern democrats didn't, especially in the border states which were violently against it. 

Congress freed the slaves in DC in 1862 (with compensation to loyalists), and abolished it in territories without comp. They followed with emancipation without comp for all rebels and enforced as the army marched through those places. Northern generals seized slaves as contraband of war (liberating them, encouraging runaways during the war) or declared them free (without power and Lincoln rescinded those orders). African Americans ran away and were forced to deal with their uncertain status. 

Emancipation proclamation placed it at center stage after long thinking about it and pressuring border states to present their own plan (they didn't). Democrats never came to the negotiating table. Enormous black immigration forced the need and he needed foreign support. The north also wanted to punish the south and weaken their war effort. It only applied to parts of rebellion territory so not border states. Lincoln also used various sets of these arguments depending on the audience and was critiqued on both sides. 

It bitterly divided the north and probably harmed them in the short term. Confederacy claimed it was to stir insurrection. 

In the end it denied labor to the south, put black men in uniform, and helped with foreign affairs. The US began the long story of segregating the armed forced. The confederates offered blacks no quarter. But this fighting gave them ironclad rights to citizenship and helped with abolition effort. 

With so many whites away at war, southern slaves ran away easier. The confederate congress in desperation tried to arm slaves. 

The Senate approved the 13th amendment and it passed in the house. States wrote new constitutions abolishing slavery. Finally passed after the war. What wasn't certain was what to do with blacks after the war.
## Foreign Affairs

Early on, no one really knew what Europe would do. The Confederacy sought recognition from France and especially Great Britain, supplying them with much of their cotton for their looms. They wanted the British to intervene in the US blockade and perhaps bring war. 

They pressured an embargo on cotton sales and the British government was pressured to do something. The policy of withholding ended up failing, a crop was already shipped and that gave Britain large stockpiles; Britain found other sources in India and Egypt; jobs lost in textiles were made up (somewhat) in Iron and munitions. 

The Northern blockage caused tension between the US and Britain/France. International law said a blockade had to be effective to be binding to neutral nations but it wasn't totally sealing the whole huge coastline especially early on. Britain decided not to challenge it, since they often enforced similar blockades and arguments in favor of them and didn't want to look bad- a major disappointment to the South. 

The US and British almost came to blows in 1861 when the US seized a British ship and took two Confederate diplomats. Britain sent troops to Canada and increased its naval presence. Lincoln administration secretary of state successfully defused the situation. 

Britain and France almost recognized the Confederacy in the Fall of 1862 after Lee's major successes, showing that the Eastern theater drew more attention. Napoleon III urged recognition but wouldn't do anything without Britain. This is why Antietam (and the emancipation) was so important- during the war the British were debating mediation and recognition. The final proclamation made it such that Britain would never ally with the South. The British did make warships for the South, but didn't end up sending the iron-side ones (they did sell merchant raiding ships).  

Overall, the Confederacy could never string together enough victories and obviously were pro-slavery. 

## Impact

The war marked the definitive dominance of the federal government over the states. It also conclusively resolved the issue of slavery that had plagued the country since its first day. 

It was bloodier than all other wars combined for Americans. The South was rendered destroyed not unlike Europe after the world wars. Its economy fell 50% while the North's grew 50% between 1860 and 1870.
