## Industrialization

By the end of the civil war and beyond, the US was becoming a great industrial power, rivalling and eventually surpassing England and Germany. It was supplied well naturally, the Bessemer process made steal production easier. Bissel and drake drilled for "rock oil" (vs. whale oil) with a salt drill. There was a PA oil rush in 1859. Rockefeller and Carnegie (From the UK) formed their huge businesses. Edison invented a bunch of telegraph stuff and the lightbulb (people could work at night now). Alternating current became a thing. Bell patented the telephone.  

Rockefeller bought out or partnered with competition to reduce it, engaging in vertical integration and mass operations. He aimed for quality control (hence "standard" oil). Mass production brought the costs of Kerosene down and soon the automobile would propel him even higher. 

This marked the start of the belief that the next day will be brighter and bring more cool stuff, instead of the era where you're expected to live more or less the same way as your parents. The government encouraged innovation, and entrepreneurs became celebrities (while others called them robber-barons). 

Monopolies pop-up all over, inequality increased, and labor movements arise but find difficulty. Legal conditions are weighted heavily in favor companies. Some wealthy advocated for social responsibility for themselves (donating riches which also helped clean up their names), or engaged in social Darwinism.

## Trains

The transcontinental railroad was planned in the 1850s and delayed by the civil war. Subsidized by land grants and cash payments, purchasing land and enforcing eminent domain where necessary, it was built by Chinese immigrants in the West and a mix of Union veterans and Irish immigrants in the East. Telegraph ran along the routes to communicate train locations. Routes were controversial because wherever it would go, the towns would be made; and where towns weren't already they might pop up.  

It took the whole economy: steel from the East, wood from the Midwest, huge labor forces, etc. Buffalo bill got his name hunting buffalo for the builders. It faced indian attacks, especially the surveyors. Stanford drove in the golden spike. 

It was the first all-season transport, and it became a hub for tourism along routes, particularly in some early, pre-national-park areas (such as the grand canyon). It opened up the whole country to development and to be a more uniform economy and national marketing campaigns started. In the 1890s, refrigerated cars made it possible to ship produce year round. 

## The End of Indian Land

By 1870, technology disparity between whites and Indians had made independence impossible. Whites hunted buffalo herds for food but also to undermine Indians. Whites generally didn't obey treaties which were supposed to be enforced by the Army, but it was reluctant to do so, especially when gold rushes stampeded people into Indian territory. 

Many plains Indians were warrior societies and had ridden wild horses, escaped from early European contact. The victory at little big horn (1876) against general Custer, lead by Sitting Bull in Eastern Montana was the last major Indian victory of the frontier, aside from isolated incidents such as Geronimo or Chief Joseph. They were entirely overwhelmed, and for Little Big Horn, the US Army responded in mass with Violence. 

Plains Indians liked guns for tribal warfare, but that forced them to remain in contact with Whites for ammo and repairs, hence their eagerness to engage in the fur trades. By the 1840s they were largely extinct from disease and settlers were passing by in masses. 

After the civil war, US policy would shift between destroying Indian culture, and making treaties to confine them. In the 60/70s, there were many conflicts over land. White fear and greed prompted many Indian massacres, especially the sand creek massacre. Indians occasionally did the same, but the whites were more aggressive and terrified; meanwhile in the East (in contrast to the West) Americans saw Indians philanthropically, attempting to educate them into society.

## Farming and Moving West

Farming the plains was made possible by the railroad. Trains shipping in Wood for building and fuel (and coal), and would take out surplus. Clearing the fields was easy compared to Eastern woodlands. The homestead act encouraged almost free settlement, and thinning buffalo herds made it easier to farm. New technologies came out that also aided, although roving bands of laborers still existed as late as the 1950s. Famine was essentially ended in America and farms suffered overproduction. 

People moved west in droves, from the East and from Europe. Commercial cropping quickly popped up and many towns were along the railroad. Ranching became common, cattle grown in TX would be driven to Abilene and shipped to Chicago to feed the Eastern industry. Cowboy's melancholic songs were actually often to soothe cows. Barbed wire fencing would eventually end the open range.

Monocropping (corn, wheat) made farming complicated (grasshoppers could eat monocrops). Prairie fires were common, and rainfall was varied in the plains. Defeated wagon trains would also go east sometimes (in god we trusted, in Kansas we busted). Sometimes the loneliness was too much. Eventually some guy figured out how to draw up land plots based on river systems for irrigation, and Mormons in Salt Lake were early adopters of this. Congress finally relented and enacted the Newlands act, where the government would shoulder the cost of dams and irrigation schemes for settler farmers.

## Post-Reconstruction Black Experience

Following reconstruction, southern redeemers and ex-confederates took control (white elites ruled basically for the next 80 years until the civil rights movement) and promoted the "new south" of industrialization. Most blacks lived as sharecroppers (they paid a share of the crop to landowners), but cotton was not the boom crop it used to be and they got stuck in debt cycles over rented equipment. This actually had the effect of backfiring since workers who didn't own the land had no interest in improving the land and the agricultural progress stagnated in the South. 

After 1877 southern governments sought economic diversity, such as the Duke family reaching monopoly on cigarettes, Birmingham became a steel town, coal mining in KY and WV, textiles in the Carolinas (southern textiles became famous for child labor policies), and a massive forestry industry. Scientific forestry began in the Built institute in N. Carolina. 

They generally disenfranchised Blacks and then passed segregation laws, and nearly stripped blacks of all of their rights. Periodically there were lynchings, mostly of blacks but occasionally of white outsiders. In the 1880s and 90s states rewrote their constitutions to exclude blacks around the new amendments such as the grandfather clause in LA (you couldn't vote if your grandfather didn't vote in 1867 before the 15th amendment was ratified), with poll taxes that many blacks couldn't pay, and literacy tests (much of the South was illiterate, but this was even more so among blacks) where they included understanding clauses where they permitted whites to vote if they could "understand" the constitution. This process was very uneven across the South in terms of how quickly it went. 

Jim Crow was also introduced around this time as legally enforced segregation. Motivated by racism that blacks born since slavery was abolished would be less subservient. Plessy V. Fergusson upheld separate but equal (they weren't) in LA. This was actually controversial since there now needed more infrastructure (e.g. railroads needed more cars). Majority of whites were, however, greatly in favor of this and new south advocates thought it was natural and that both races wanted it. Churches were the only place that blacks seem to have actually chosen segregation. Black schools were deeply underfunded and black illiteracy was high even in the highly illiterate south. State governments turned a blind eye to lynchings.

Black leaders were split over how to handle this. Some advocated accepting their conditions (notable not favoring it) and working within them. Booker T. Washington advocated for laboring and that whites trust blacks over immigrants. Blacks voted for Republicans as the party of Lincoln until FDR. Republican presidents (Teddy, Taft) would consult with Washington before making black appointments. Du Bois criticized Washington as a black leader in white eyes only and too willing to compromise and instead advocated for black leaders and challenging segregation and founded the NAACP which legally challenged many segregation laws such at the grandfather clause. 

Soon blacks moved from southern agriculture and into cities and factories. 

## Men and Women

Middle class Americans believed in the differences in the sexes and that each had their own role: men were muscular for working while women were fragile and moral, nurturing homemakers. Even women's rights advocates believed in differences as a unique aspect of women's perspective for voting (as opposed to the more modern women's movements which emphasized the similarities between men and women). 

Usually couples were too poor for this and early on, women simply worked different roles on the farm; but in cities, there was a physical distance which lead to more deliberate tasking differences for each often backed by pseudoscience. They became consumers, and they most commonly worked as domestic servants. Homemakers had a ton of work to do around the home without modern appliances and servants filled that role so there was a steady supply of women filling those roles (particularly immigrant women), but they also became nurses, grade school teachers, department store salespeople, etc. Women were seen as frail and were encouraged not to overeducate.

Men, in this middle class theory, were tough, competitive and cerebral. They believed in social Darwinism especially in economics which expected ruthless business behavior (why some corruption was tolerated). The ideal wife then makes a nurturing home to recharge the men's batteries. Churches thought they were becoming too feminized so they sold a belief of muscular Christianity that Jesus was a tough guy. The YMCA tried to recruit masculine men to evangelism via sports. Most famously muscular Christian was Teddy Roosevelt. 

Because of these perceived differences, women's voting advocates claimed to want to change the way society ran, to make society more moral. Some women's suffrage movements were quite upset that "uneducated savage black men" got the vote before them.  

More important was the women's Christian temperance union which wanted alcohol abolished (early on it just advocated drinking less). One woman advocated for the white life, which aimed to rid society of the sexual double standard that men were naturally more promiscuous and it advocated for celibacy until marriage and that sex should only be used for procreation. Another lady became famous just smashing up bars. Sometimes these things combined, and women felt the need for temperance to protect against marital rape; back in the day pregnancy was a (more) serious ordeal. 

In the late 19th century some younger women began to challenge this theory of a "women's separate world", and started to play a more active role in social and political life. One woman advocated for contraception and disseminated information about it to working class families, overcoming the Comstock laws which prohibited the dissemination of sexual information through the mail

## Religion

In the late 19th century, religion was much more about a friendship with Jesus than the wrath of an angry god (see above about the masculine Christian response as well). They preached thinking about the salvation of society (not just individual) and to help the poor and grim urban conditions. They also participated in temperance. Immigrants from Ireland and Eastern and central Europe brought more Catholics. The phrase "what would Jesus do" originates from a book around here. 

Wealthy protestants build more ornate churches. Around this time, predestination moves aside for voluntary conversion. Also churches split on liberal/evangelical lines. Some see Darwinism and geology and question the literality of the bible, while some stick to the bible as god's infallible word (fundamentalists- get their name from books they published). Historians also study the stories in the bible, seeing some as contradictory, as being in different styles or times. Comparative literature shows the flood story showing up all over the world and they see the bible as a compilation of stories instead of god's direct word, which somewhat undermined the bible's message. Even within each group there were splits. 

Some saw social Darwinism and poor people as evidence of sin while others understood the business cycle. Social and urban Christians see capitalism as anti-Christian and various gradations of that. 

Following the potato famine in the 50s, mass Irish migration brought Catholicism in large numbers, they were the largest group of Catholics; and of course the protestants didn't like that. Anti-Catholic messaging cropped up everywhere. Catholics created their own schools over distaste for the American public schooling system's bias. 

Other European immigrants diversified the Catholics after 1870. American Catholics fought very hard to keep American Catholicism united but in the short term for neighborhoods this obviously was challenged. 

Jews tended to be more urbanized from Germany and integrated easily. In the US a branch of Judaism, conservative Judaism, arose as a middle ground between orthodox and modernism. After 1880, due to conditions in Eastern Europe (attacks, etc) large Jewish populations started coming to the US. American Jews saw these immigrants as barbaric and feared antisemitism from general populations seeing that. 

Mormons were a homegrown Religion and Brigham Young lead the Mormons to Utah where they adapted new farming tactics. In 1879 there's a court case for violated bigamy statutes and SCOTUS rejected the defense. In some ways Mormons gave up polygamy for statehood. 

Jehovah's Witnesses were dedicated to preparing for the end of the world in 1914, and many took the war as the start of the end.

Scientologists denied the reality of the material world as a projection of the mental condition. It denied stimulants, and that sickness was due to mind states so they rejected medicine. 

## Populism

A political movement among farmers. Southern cotton tenant farmers and sharecroppers, black and white, were becoming chronic debtors, cotton prices falling amidst global competition from Egypt and India. Midwestern grain farmers were paying too much for railroads and going into debt over new farm equipment. All of the production drove down the price of food (good for consumers obviously), but some farmers reacted by making more which increased surpluses. 

The 19th century was a period of sustained deflation. There wasn't enough money in circulation to match the increase in population or production so prices tended to fall, exacerbating the problems for producers. In the Midwest, this particularly affected their borrowing for newer mechanized farm equipment to maintain competitive production, since loans get worse in deflation. This caused constant cycles of bankruptcy in Western farmers.

When farmers sold crops the grain merchants set the price at the sale, and when purchasing factory goods, the sellers set the price. Railroads had made development possible, but they had local monopolies and could set the price. Generally same story with grain elevators. Shipping and storage prices were very high. (See *The Octopus* book).

They formed groups like the granger movement aimed for mutual social and educational assistance. They tried to bypass banks: in the 1880s they tried to setup cooperatives and marketing arrangements to bypass grain elevators, including some plans for government owned storage facilities. Of course, railroad and grain elevator lobbyists helped stop this. Instead they decided to form a party built on the unlikely (especially since it crossed the color barrier and the north-south border) alliance between these two groups. The greenback party campaigned for inflation early on. 

Political gatherings tended to take on the same flavor as religious revival events, with charismatic speakers. Southern alliances were racially integrated and organizers encouraged them to integrate and unite against unified Railroads, store owners, land owners, etc. 

Only after being outmaneuvered did these organizations politically organize directly. The People's Party in 1892 campaigned against corruption in newspapers, capitalist dominance, predatory practices, etc. (see Caesar's Column). They called for the direct election of Senators, nationalization of railroads and telephone/telegraph, a part of the grain storage plan, the free coinage of silver to create inflation, graduated income tax, and (for industrialists) 8 hour working day and a ban on immigrants (employers hired immigrants as strike breakers).

They only had local success, never national. There were great beliefs in conspiracy that bankers caused all of this, that foreign and domestic Jews were involved (antisemitism), they distrusted city dwellers and immigrants.
