## The American System

The war was a bitch slap of truth for Republicans. The (expired) bank would have made it possible to put more money into the war; ultra-low taxes had made infrastructure and the military pitiful. Madison asked Congress for new taxes to beef up the military, to recharter the bank, and to fund national roads from the bank. This horrified some Republicans, but Clay (speaker now) and Calhoun spearheaded a party shift to "National Republicanism" in support of these new policies and got them passed.

Madison vetoed the bill and so the Republicans deliberately chose Monroe for the next election, who supported the bills and launched a second war against Barbary pirates, partly in support for the Navy.

The Cumberland highway and a bunch of turnpikes were built, but Fulton's steamboat was the big new thing, turning water ways into highways. By the 1830s steamboats had made shipping goods cheaper and faster than ever, so much that where rivers weren't they built canals.

The Erie Canal was a huge risk and an even bigger success, setting off a storm of canal building. But soon the railroad steam engine came and eclipsed the canal. Soon it was so fast and cheap to ship goods that commerce made its way into agrarian societies, where localism slowly was replaced by commerce. For example they bought textiles instead of making them themselves; and this lead to single crop farming to pay for those goods. 

This lead farmers to borrow more and use cash exchange, wilting the face-to-face exchange. Currency and banking grew, stock brokering appeared in NYC. Prosperity made Monroe pretty popular with everyone. 

## American Transformation

In the early 1800s, the birthrate amongst American's was falling from its peak (still high). The Napoleonic wars had ended in 1815 and the flow of European immigrants resumed, more than picking up the slack, namely from the British isles (between 1815-1840) continuing the boom of population growth, pushed out of Europe by high populations (their death rate had been falling), poor industrial conditions, limited land, high taxes, famine (1825-1829), the promise of American freedom and land.

Immigrants didn't need passports, certificates, etc., all they needed was to literally get here. Transportation revolution could take them out of the coastal cities as well, preventing any large-scale anti-immigrant sentiment. 

Following 1812, little Indian resistance remained East of the Mississippi, in the Northern Woodlands and in the south due to Jackson. Land was cheap and made available. It was sold to land speculators in 640 acre lots, who chopped them up to sell to individuals at a profit. At one point congress even shrunk the lots and cheapened the acreage price. Some settlers, bypassed the system altogether, squatting on uninhabited land to. Congress legitimized titles by pre-emption: a means for a squatter to buy out the title of land he was farming at the congress price of $1.25/acre. Squatters conflicted with speculators at times, for squatting on land that had already been bought.

Land speculators played a huge role. They, not the government, bought up large swathes of land and laid foundations for villages and cities, lobbied for infrastructure to their developments, and took financial risks for development. A byproduct of this is that speculators bought land and sold it at a higher price- people only bought what they could use. This meant that there was less demand for slavery to work very large estates. 

The country grew, coastal cities grew, inland cities grew. Manufacturing shifted from individual manufacturers (e.g. shoemaker) the putting-out system and wage-laborers. Entrepreneurs paid people wages and kept profits for themselves. Wealth inequality grew fast.

For many, they escaped west to new land, but that wasn't an option for everyone. Economically it could be prohibitive, but to some groups it was socially impossible. Free blacks would not have been able to vote outside of New England, and even in the North they had to use segregated facilities, and confined to unskilled labor. In some areas they formed their own groups and fought for their liberty, but in as many they were failed: in many states their immigration was banned. 

People moved so much, they built cheaper homes that could be disassembled and moved. 

## Panic of 1819

All of this movement (and the reaction to the war of 1812) killed Republican cultural idealism and so they split into two factions: Clay and the National Republicans representing economic growth and development; and the backlash to that agenda and the panic of 1819: Andrew Jackson and the Democrats. 

US retained the monopoly on minting official currency, the rest issued paper bank notes, IOUs against the security of the gold and silver in their vault. But after 1812 they issued way more notes than they had specie. The British cotton market experienced a recession and the price of cotton fell by more than half. The British merchants began denying acceptance of bank notes, and so southern farmers went to their state banks to get specie. State banks foreclosed mortgages and loans and demanded payment in specie. Not everyone could pay so many of those with notes got nothing. The national bank called in loans to state banks in specie. 

This was hugely widespread, for example in Philly, 3/4 of the wage earners were let go and thousands were jailed for unpaid debts. 

The reaction to this was a general disaffection with new government policies:
1. Built pressure to pass debt relief laws (not clear if it was legal, in Article I forbids states from impairing the obligation of contracts). Postpone sales of property, Sheriffs could only liquidate property if it met 2/3 of the value (neighbors often conspired as the jury to say that it didn't), some state courts denied to hear debt collections, and collectors were forced to take payment in bank notes. 
2. Some banks simply closed or had their charters revoked. There was general outrage at banks and there was call to revoke their charters, and even some called for an amendment to ban banks. 
3. Push for voter reform; give more votes to the people to take power out of the hands of aristocrats who were seen as doing this to the average people. Property qualifications for voting were removed. Voter participation rates skyrocketed, higher than today for eligible voters (white men). The Republican party changed its primary process from a party caucus among congressmen to state legislatures to national party conventions. 

#supremecourt The only thing stopping all of this from cascading was the law and supreme court, defending contracts and fairness against the "mob". Alexis de Tocqueville stated this in a paper somewhere, and John Marshall believed that. 

In 1819 they heard Dartmouth College vs. Woodward: the college was protesting the NH legislature to rewrite the charter to allow the legislature to appoint new trustees to seize control of the college. Daniel Webster defended the college and the court upheld that corporate charters constituted contracts, stating that no state can violate the constitutional ban on contract impairment. By extension, every other attempt to do this was illegal. Sturgeous vs Crown and Shield protested NY bankruptcy law allowing debtors to obtain easy refuge from creditors. In Gibbons vs. Ogden, a case about granting of monopolies to ferry and steamboat operators to certain waterways, Marshall invoked the commerce clause to prevent states from stifling market competition; states had to permit free competition among interstate waterways. 

>[!Note]
>Before commercialism and capitalism, the law and lawyers were seen as a gentile profession to oversee communal norms of morality, but in the new world it became a profession of arbitrating contract disputes. 

The people turned to a bold leader at the federal level to enact these policies.
