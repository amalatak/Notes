## Southern Society and Defense of Slavery

All over the world Europe was abolishing slavery, and until the 1830s it looked like the US would go the same way. The US was, unlike the West Indies, without a major cash crop and Britain patrolled the seas for slave ships hampering the slave trade. In addition, many Americans were embarrassed by the hypocrisy of slavery and in the North many states banned the practice. However, many slaves were often not set free immediately; some were shoo-ed away to colonies like "Liberia", and in the North the hated blacks were sent away to the South- they had white immigrants to work in their factories for cheap instead. 

Major anti-slavery movements arose around Protestantism where they believed worship should be totally unrestricted of free, disinterested (impartial) people. Slaves couldn't choose and was a testament against gods decrees and human freedom and so the practice should be opposed. Quakers opposed slavery as well.

Many southerners agreed and tobacco (a major slave crop) was in decline. Virginia removed restraints on individual emancipation and Southerners were remarkably indifferent in 1787 of the Constitution's indifference to slavery. Instead the government had the power to regulate and abolish the trade, outside of the 3/5 compromise. At early conventions people put out movements to abolish slavery outright. Northwest territory ordinance declared no slavery in the territory.

But the spinning Jenny and Cotton Gin made cheap, mass produced textiles easier to produce and cotton cheaper to produce, creating a new cash crop. Fear drove opposition as well. Growing slave populations were seen as large hostile groups and the slave rebellion in San Domingue in addition to smaller scale revolts domestically rendered slave owners anxious. The Amistad, a Spanish ship, was hijacked by its stowed slaves and was ordered freed and returned to Africa, driving more fear between southerners of Northern opposition to slavery. Finally, a Turner Insurrection in 1851, butchered whites convincing Virginia to prevent any move towards emancipation. He preached mass racial murder and convinced whites that slavery was the only means of protecting themselves. 

Southerners manufactured pro-slavery ideology, not in simple racism sorting people on the basis of color. In contrast to the Enlightenment principles of equality among all people, the Romantic movement stressed irrational values, sometimes in racial characteristics. Races existed in a hierarchy with Africans as subordinate. Characteristics were measured to "show" Africans only fit for slavery and "enjoyed" it (ignoring the revolts). Southerners who found racism too crude, they defended slavery as some benign household institution with slaves living in one great big family. Others were defending of economic reasons, "there must be a lowest of a low to do things no one else wants to", there must be a "mudsill" (put link here to mudsill theory). They also made the case that slaves were better off than factory workers. 

Many slaveholders were still filled with doubt. Non-slave owners struggled to compete with slave-owners, and so they pushed for a white-democracy where all whites shared a common superiority to blacks. Brutality took a moral toll as well, knowing full well their exploitation especially if they were religious. Cotton also wore out the soil and pushed slavers further south, increasing slave population (decreasing demand and so price) in southern concentrations. 

#### Northern Emancipation ideology

In the 1830s it manifested out of nowhere and was radical and militant in its absolutism. William Lloyd Garrison spoke out without equivocation, actually pissing off moderates and churches for their lukewarm responses. 

Southerners looked at abolitionists through fear, believing the entire north abolitionists. Southern legislatures criminalize "northern propaganda" and repealed emancipation laws. Religious organizations were split. Postmasters censored "suspicious mail" and newspapers. Southerners implemented a gag rule in the house about slave rules. 

## Manifest Destiny

M.D. - the belief that America would rule all of North America. Mostly by southern slavers looking to expand East, but also fueled by Romanticism of the West from writers, artists and adventuresome Mountain men. 

Americans were excited about the optimism of the West. It was still filled with Indians and some foreign settlements, and Spain still controlled an empire there until 1821. Indians were ignored as savages and their resistance was crushed in 1812 making it easier to push across the Mississippi. 

Tribes conflicted over resistance or acceptance, and they got pretty good at using "white" law against Americans. Indian removal was attempted under Monroe as early as 1825 but it wasn't until Jackson that large scale efforts ensued to uproot the Cherokee in GA, which was somewhat surprising since the Cherokee had gone so far to imitate white culture having a constitution (and even black slaves). They appealed to SCOTUS and won, but Jackson ignored them. He forced them in the winter of 1838/39 westward in the "trail of tears" to Oklahoma and about a quarter died on route. 

Manifest destiny caused conflicts not only with the natives, but with Britain over Canadian territory definition. The Texas example also inspired wackos to go to other unstable territories to overthrow and petition to join America. 

#### Missouri Compromise 

Their genocide opened up some fine agricultural land, and Americans also spread West faster than anticipated. The government had a system to settle lands and then petition for statehood. This generated two political conflicts

1.Missouri (first west of the MI) applied for statehood with slavery in its constitution. This challenged free states since there were 11 of each when Missouri applied. Northerners saw this as a threat to the national republican (mostly northern) effort of industrial and internal development. In 1819, an amendment was added to bar slaves from being imported to Missouri and free them all once they reach 25. Southern delegations erupted in anger. It passed the house but died in the Senate. For the first time sectionalism had arrived. 

But by then Maine had applied and they were admitted at the same time. Henry Clay then called for a division along the 36 degree latitude, above which all states would be free and below which could be slave and this was signed by Monroe. This Missouri compromise made Clay. Slaveholders believed they had gotten the better end of the deal since it was assumed that the US would take southern land from Spain in Texas (this wasn't in the country yet).

#### Texas

As late as 1820 Spain had clung to parts of their empire, but its strength was still ebbing and revolutions were occurring all over in the 1800s. In 1820 the king was challenged by an uprising among his officers demanding a republic. In the meantime, Mexico revolted and set up a Monarchy and in 1823 that was overthrown for a Republic, which was weak and fractious. In 1833 Santa Anna overthrew it and set himself up as a dictator a la Napoleon while the Mexican states were left to themselves. In Cojilia (including Texas) the population was sparse and the local government starting in 1820 set up a system to franchise out large sections of land to North Americans under the empresario system. And so large colonies of Americans moved to Texas, where they began farming and ranching, especially cotton (meaning slaves). 

Soon the Americans ignored demands by the local government to conform (speak Spanish, convert to Catholicism) and began to dwarf the local population. Anxious that America would setup an independent Texas government, Santa Anna revoked state autonomy and sealed the border with Louisiana to shut off immigration. But the Mexican troops provoked an uprising and in 1835 the Texans drove Santa Anna's men back across the Rio Grande. In 1836 the Anglos and Tejanos (who didn't care for Santa Anne either) declared their independence in March 1836. 

At first the rebellion didn't look great, but Santa Anna's 4000 men were held up at the Alamo. Insignificant militarily, Santa Anna put every survivor to death, pissing off and shocking American colonists. In 1836 Sam Houston and the Texans captured Santa Anna and forced him to sign an agreement recognizing Texas' independence. 

Santa Anne repudiated it immediately, but Texas' long term goal was always to join the US. Van Buren and the US were not anxious to adopt another slave state, especially one technically owned by Mexico and the panic of 1837 only complicated things, as Van Buren was not anxious to assume Texan debts from the revolution. In 1840, the election brought the Whig WHH to the WH who preferred internal development over expansionism. 

But WHH died after one month and Tyler took the reigns, beefing with Clay and Webster over a new Bank, tariffs, internal development, all vetoed. Tyler negotiated an annexation treaty with Texas as an alternative strategy for 1844. 

## War with Mexico

Polk was an annexationist. He wanted Texas, to force the British out of Oregon and he was a slave owner. The election solidified the annexation of Texas in 1845. Clay ended his career over Texas, pissing off both sides. 

Mexico was not happy about this and they sent an envoy to Calhoun to warn him that Texas was still a Mexican province, they would regard annexation as an act of aggression. Polk attempted negotiations and the Mexican president had no choice but to be hardline should Santa Anna make a return; who even sent a messenger to Polk to try and leverage US aid to overthrow the current government. Nevertheless it was overthrown by someone else. 

By 1845 Polk sent Taylor and a bunch of troops to the Texas border. There was dispute as to where the border was (Nueces or Rio Grande). Taylor eventually moved to the Rio Grande, on route he collided with some Mexican scouts. Soon Mexican army of 5k men crossed the Rio Grande and surrounded Taylor's encampment, who moved to battle. 

Over one of the ambushes, Polk asked for Congress to declare war over conflict on US territory. Neither country was super prepared for war and many Americans were still organized and equipped like the revolution. Polk wanted to reinforce with State volunteers, creating a weird division in ranks between the professionals and a bunch of random volunteers. The Mexican was larger and more practiced, but was ill equipped logistically and their ranks were conscripted and amateurish or held by political connections and barely paid. 

Taylor captured Monterrey and the American Navy slipped Santa Anna back into Mexico where he was given command of the Army and conflicted with Taylor who crushed the Mexicans with artillery. 

Polk ordered mounted dragoons and some volunteers to Santa Fe (success) and they moved to San Diego to rendezvous with War ships and Californians had imitated Texans to stage their own revolt and all of these people defeated the Mexican governor of California; hello, California. The remaining troops in Santa Fe took El Paso. 

There was a huge American landing at Vera Cruz with Army and Navy as one of the great military activities and they pushed to the Mexican capital. Santa Anna attempted to cut them off, but failed and they took the capital, ending the war. 

This was a small scale war generally speaking and fairly poorly run, but the war went better for America than was expected and proved a training ground for eventual officers in the Civil War. 

The treaty of Guadeloupe-Hidalgo was signed. Mexico ceded huge territories including CA, NM, parts of CO, UT, NV, and formally recognize Rio Grand as border with TX. They agreed to pay $15m to settle claims and debts and eventually they sold the Gadsden purchase in modern AZ to pay part of this. (CA gold rush starts almost immediately). 

## Great Compromise

The war was seen by some as a vehicle for expanding slavery to match the mostly northern Louisiana Purchase after the MO compromise, especially since the Oregon territory was meagerly split. Others saw the war as unethical. Some thought more people would spread south to central america and beyond to expand slavery further. 

Four Agendas took shape with the Mexican Cession (all the land ceded in that treaty)
1. A condition of land acquisition from Mexico was that it be slave free (Wilmot proviso) which was killed in the Senate, but Polk called to extend the MO compromise line all the way. 

Calhoun believed that all territories were slave territories since any American property (including slaves) could be taken to any territory. Northern democrats agreed that congress couldn't impose slavery agenda, but that the people living there had the choice. Polk tried his solution but failed and retired from the presidency at the end of his term. 

Democrats split, Northern democrats nominated their own anti-slavery nominee for presidency based on the principle that congress had full authority to ban slavery in territories (Wilmot or nothing). This northern split marked the slavery issue from a moral question to a sectional political issue. The Whigs took advantage of this and Taylor, the war hero, made no obvious choices about the issue, and the Whigs adopted no party platform. 

When Taylor took office, the CA gold rush was in full swing and NM/CA were organizing into new governments as anti-slave; Taylor had become anti-slavery. CA applied as free, southern fire-eaters called for slave-holding state convention and Taylor faced a challenge from Clay opting to the following plan: admit CA as free, but NM and UT would be organized under their own sovereignty on the issue; he also proposed a new fugitive slave law giving slave holders new powers to stop runaway slaves; finally a resolution denying congress the authority to interfere in the interstate slave trade. The slave state representatives rejected the idea considering free CA as tantamount to adopting Wilmont proviso and Northerners rejected the UT/NM article. Calhoun wrote a dramatic response that if Southerners were prevented from moving with their slaves into the new territories then they might be better leaving the Union. Webster, surprising many fellow Northerners didn't call for free states, but for unity and adoption of Clay's plan to save the Union. Clay's bill failed and he retired, as did Webster. 

Stephen Douglas (a democrat) took up Clay's bill and worked it to pass and Fillmore signed them. This averted a showdown over the territories, allowed the MO compromise law to stand in the LA purchase territories, and popular sovereignty for the Mexican cession (except for free CA). It implemented the new fugitive slave law and passed the interstate slave resolution. Lastly it made Douglas a giant. But this only kicked the can down the road. 

## Reactions to the Great Compromise

The 1850s saw demographic change with huge immigration and a panic in 1857. 

#### Fugitive Slave Law

Reactions to the fugitive slave law were captured in literature via Uncle Tom's Cabin, which drove Northern disgust and Southern critique with their own counter publications. Runaway slaves were returned to the south by the government, which Northerners didn't see fit for the government to do. The Anthony Burnes case is the most famous, and President Pierce honored the commitments of the law. 

Northern State passed laws to frustrate the federal law and sued the federal government but lost. See Ableman v. Boothe. Ironically, the North called for states rights and the South called for greater central authority. 

#### National Party Fracture 

Historians don't know certainly why the Whig party declined, but issues relating to Slavery played a role. In 1852, the Whigs in the South backed Fillmore (A Northerner of Southern principles, a doughface, a Northern Democrat who voted the way Southerners would want them to). Northern Whigs backed Scott and it took forever for him to get the nomination. Scott was crushed by Pierce, another doughface. Also Catholic Irish and German immigrants tended to vote Democrat, Whigs were more anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic. Many Whigs began to look elsewhere. 

#### Kansas-Nebraska Act

Douglass thought this bill up seeking to take attention West and away from Slavery. Also for a railroad. He wanted to let the territories decide for themselves. Northerners and abolitionists hated the bill but it passed, voiding the MO compromise. Northerners felt betrayed and Whigs reeled. Democrats began to look for a new home as well since the party in the North seemed controlled by slave-holding interests in the South. The North saw the Fugitive Slave Act and repeal of the MO compromise as a sign that there was too much power in the South. The KS-NB Act brought the death of the Whigs and the re-alignmend of the Democrats in support of Southern slaveholders.

Who would replace the Whigs was a different question. Know-nothings were anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic, but couldn't control sectional splits dominated by slavery. Republican party (not Jefferson's) was founded to oppose the extension of slavery into the territories. They opposed the KS-NB Act. They ran in Freemont in 1856 in a truly sectional election and called for prohibition of slavery in all territories, alienating Democrats. The mudslinging ensued. Democrats nominated Buchanan and ran with the KS-NB Act. Fillmore ran as third party. The vote was totally sectional and the 2nd party system was done replaced with a third party, sectional system. 

#### Religious Sectionalism

Sectional divides cropped up in Religious institutions. Northerners and Southerners believed they were different. Churches divided over slavery. Methodists split, Baptists split, Presbyterians kind of did, Catholics ignored it, etc. This mixing of Religion and politics created an extremely passionate split, and in the North congregations sent guns to Kansas (Beecher's Bibles), with churches contributed to the problem instead of solving it. 

#### Bleeding Kansas

Northerners and Southerners poured into Kansas and fought. Border ruffians from Missouri, pro-slavery elements took up the fight as well. Pierce supported the slave-owners. Sumner gave a speech against the South. A South Carolina representative caned him for the speech. In 1857 a bogus pro-slavery KS constitution was passed which was boycotted by anti-slavery people (Buchanan supported it). 

## Tensions Escalate

This pretty much describes the erosion of trust in the government. It also lead to fear and belief of intolerance for a Republican in the South. At this point, no one knew that secession was right down the road.
#### Dredd Scott Decision
The court was the last institution to remain untested regarding slavery extending into the territories. Dredd Scott was a slave whose master had taken him to free WI and returned to MO. Backed by abolitionists he sued for freedom that existing in a free territory made him free. In Dredd Scott vs. Sanford the court decided by 5-4 a sweeping ruling (with support of Buchanan) against Scott, aggravating sectional tensions and curtailing supreme court credibility. 

They decided as a black slave that Scott was not a citizen and he had no standing. Further they decided that even should he been free, he would have lost because of the "unconstitutional MO compromise" (which had been OBE by KS-NB act anyway), stating that congress had no right to tell people where they could take their property. 

Northerners and Republicans attacked this as part of the conspiracy of Southern slave power controlling government. Further, it directly attacked Republican cause of slavery expansion and open the entire country to slavery, e.g. why couldn't a slave-holder just move to Boston. The popular sovereignty group also seemed to take a blow from this. Only the South was happy. 
#### Illinois and Lincoln

In 1858, Lincoln challenged Douglass for the IL Senate seat. Douglass was instrumental in passing the compromise of 1850 and was a popular Democrat. He was against the Lee-Compton constitution in KS, costing him Southern support; Dredd Scott caused him a further dilemma. 

Lincoln was a smart and successful Lawyer, an early convert from Whig and opposed the MX war. The two clashed in debates that got wide coverage and propelled Lincoln to National fame. It was seen as a testing ground for the clash of the two parties. 

Lincoln took the high-ground, "the Nation engaged in a great battle between the forces of freedom and the forces of slavery. A house divided against itself cannot stand." It was clear to Lincoln that the country would become full one way or another, and that the spread of slavery must be stopped and put on a course of extinction to whither and die. Douglass refused to do that, and insisted it should be up to the voters of each region and called Lincoln an abolitionist. He also accused Lincoln of being for full equality, to which Lincoln responded that they should be equal *under the law*. See the debates in full. 

Douglass won by a small margin, but pushed the South away from Douglass and made Lincoln a National figure. 
#### Harpers Ferry Raid

John Brown was a failure in life, but became hugely involved in bleeding Kansas murders, playing a role in brutal butchering of pro-slavery groups. A hero to abolitionists and a devil to pro-slavery people. A believer of immediate emancipation, and that slavery was an abomination that needed to be killed in an old testament kind of way, no matter what it took. 

In 1859 he was in Harpers Ferry, VA, plotting to seize the federal arsenal there to arm slaves and to march south in a great slave army rebellion through the mountains to violently kill the institution of slavery. 

No great rally came, and the rebellion was quickly put down and Brown and his followers were hanged. As propaganda the raid (and Browns ensuing calm during trial and hanging) was electric for Northern and abolitionists. He became a martyr for the Northern cause, and the South was horrified. Northern abolitionists had funded him and Southerners saw it as a great conspiracy to arm southern slaves and start a race-war. Nat turner's rebellion also played a role in that. Southerners could understand slaves rebelling but not White northerners, proving (to them) that the North would do anything to interfere with Southerners, causing a crisis of fear. Moderate views were ostracized in the South. 

After this, a southerner published a book calling to end slavery, seeing slavery as a break on economic development, concentrating wealth in the planter class. This scared the planter class, and when Republicans endorsed it, it led to fear that a Republican president would stoke class warfare. 
#### Economics of Sectionalism

Many Northerners, upset with too much Southern influence, envisioned a Union without the South involved in economics and so much influence in National affairs and sought an economic alliance between the West, East, and NE. Immigration was at its high point supplying badly needed labor. They moved west to purchase Northern manufactured goods and supplied raw materials to supply that manufacturing. 

As such they supported internal development (railroads, etc), and supported protective tariffs. Republicans called for a homestead act to make free land available in the West, support for trade colleges. A move towards industrial power, where the agricultural south didn't belong. 

## 1860, Its Consequences, and War

#### The election

Douglass was nominated for the Democrats despite Southern opposition over his moderate slavery views. After adopting popular sovereignty as a platform, southerners walked out. Southerner fire-eaters (radicals) nominated their own candidate because Douglass was unacceptable for his moderate position on Dredd Scott and wanted guarantees of slavery expansion. Their platform called for guarantees of slavery expansion and the annexation of Cuba as another potential slave state. Republicans nominated moderate Lincoln. There was also a random fourth do-nothing party. 

Republicans ran on opposing slavery expansion (not abolition), a high tariff, a railroad, a homestead act. They carried almost every Northern state but weren't even on the ballot in multiple southern states, who warned Lincoln's election would mean disaster. The south was split between the rest of the voters. Lincoln won with plurality in popular vote, but notably did not win Congress.

#### Fears

The South, viewing Republicans as supporters of John Brown and abolition (in addition to their general policy differences), saw their institution as threatened. It's worth noting that the south had controlled the presidency basically the entire time and saw a vision of the North running away with the presidency and congress and eventual courts and with that an eventual strike at slavery where it existed. 

#### Secession

Northerners had no short shrift for that stance, having played by the rules the entire time so far. But the slaveholding states in the deep south began secession. Sam Houston was removed as Governor for opposition to secession. Some people wanted to wait and move as a group. 

They believed the Union was a compact between states and that they could withdraw on behalf of failure to return slaves, actions of John Brown, abolition societies, etc,. The Constitution did not give a clear answer.

All the seceding states (not all of the south seceded), met with moderates writing the government. It was basically the constitution with a few exceptions: explicit protection of slavery, states rights, banned tariffs and internal improvement. Moderate Jefferson Davis was chosen as president to appeal to not-yet-seceded slave states. Their object was to preserve their system of labor and social order based on black slavery.  

Ironically, the civil war lead to the abolition of slavery whereas remaining in the Union likely would have allowed slavery to remain even longer. Democrats still controlled Congress after all, and an amendment would have been near-impossible. 

Slavery, no doubt, fueled all of this, despite after the war many confederates were worried about Constitutional issues; they certainly weren't confused about it during the secession crisis, with speeches about the cornerstone of the Confederacy is about the superiority of the white man and slavery of blacks. 

#### Reactions

The North reacted with a wait-and-see attitude, believing that the people were dominant, not the states; and they didn't accept the state-sovereignty argument, instead that the states were subordinate to the Constitution and the people. Many Americans saw the US as a beacon of democracy. Still, they waited. 

Buchanan definitely did nothing, except claimed secession was illegal but that he couldn't do anything about it since the South wasn't violent yet. Congress worked for moderation, attempting to extend the MO compromise line, add an amendment that slavery will be protected where it already exists, but Republicans rejected this (including Lincoln who was pretty quiet during this). The minimum demands of each side prevented any moderation. 

The North saw the South as being overrepresented (3/5 compromise) and wanting to spread slavery everywhere, while the South felt the rest of the country was coming for their way of life.
