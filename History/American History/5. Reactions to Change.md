## The Second Great Awakening (1800-1820)

John Randolph believed America was ungodly from the Enlightenment and European free-think thought. In truth, Christianity had never been very popular in early America. Despite some religious base for founding American colonies such as the Puritans and Quakers, they were on the radical fringes with deep grudges against the Church of England. They had a hostility towards religious authority. And the British hadn't really imposed that much restriction on religion (except for minimal impact in the South). Everywhere else, there was little or no religion at all.

 Then in the 1740s the Great Awakening came through, provoking divisions amongst religious groups. In 1775, Anglicans and Church of England clergy basically all left, who were supplanted by other religious groups.
 
Then suffering still a setback- up to, during, and after the war the government reduced role in church life, including the Bill of Rights. Enlightenment philosophy and Republicanism (based on human longing, moral, and nature) had no need for Christianity. Republican replacements sprung up such as 
* Deism - based on creation and not much else. Thomas Paine of Common Sense had some interesting writings
* Unitarianism - sprung up as a reaction to the great awakening and revivalism, rejected neither the bible nor Christianity but did insist that reason required the rejection of the Trinity and pred-destination of Calvinism. 
* Free Masonry - Originated in religious ritualism based in reason, a secretive order for English speaking elites.

Instead of Republicanism adopting religion, religion coopted Republicanism. Between 1780 and 1860, religious congregations made enormous inroads. This was due in large part to the following:
1. Resiliency of revival - the First Great Awakening, through writings became a model for spreading and this time outside of New England. 
2. Absorption of Virtue - Republicans believed the Republic was dependent on virtue. The French Revolution showed that ethical ideals of Enlightenment could lead to the Reign of Terror, but religious groups offered that religion can provide this guarantee. 
3. Millennialism - Christians coopted the optimism of Republicanism. Secular optimism was replaced by millennial optimism. 

All of this culminated in a conflict with American capitalism. Revivalists raged against market inroads, against banks and panics. That America turned to Andrew Jackson. 

## Industrialism

The industrial revolution was brought about by four things
1. Machines - though they had been in use for a while, new machines were much bigger and more complicated
2. Power - Instead of human or animal power, steam engines took place. This freed factories from being near rivers. 
3. Labor - Factories needed more and different kinds of labor. Workers went from workers to operatives, and the number of them greatly increased. Operatives were forced to pace themselves to machines and not to their own power, leading to regimentation and clock-consciousness. 
4. Capital - Early on, capitalism was really about import/export trade. Production costs remained largely the same so merchants, shipping, and trading was the driver, not production. The industrial revolution opened industrial capitalism which realized much bigger profits. 

All of this makes its way to the US in the 1820s, in part slowly due to Napoleonic wars, embargo, 1812, etc., but mostly due to British obstructionism regarding their technology. Industrial espionage played a roll in bringing over designs. 

Huge new mills seek to recruit young, single women. In Merrimack, they worked 7a.m. - 7p.m., six days a week, living in the mills in boarding houses under supervision of a matron. This prevented slums and tenement housing outside mills and they provided resources to the women to learn such as lectures and libraries, and were paid fairly well. Boston mills produced fabulous wealth and it quickly spread. 

The explosion of machines also lead to an explosion in machinery. Interchangeable parts for muskets began with Eli Whitney. The coal industry is born, industry moves into agriculture. 

Eventually, competition put local artisans and small businesses out of business, and they turned to legislatures. Additionally, competition lead to cutting prices lead to lower wages and workers organized through work stoppages and strikes. Unions popped up in the early 1830s, but state courts convicted strikers as interfering with markets and owners threatened mass firings and the use of immigrant labor. But politically, a working men's party was established in 1829 to the horror of owners in NY. Political working men eventually turned to Andrew Jackson. 

## Internal Republican Divisions

Up until 1824 elections had been generally consensus caucus around the secretary of state, but J. Q. Adams wasn't really popular enough to win this time despite his experience. Henry Clay represented the West and was Speaker of the House. Clay was pleading for his American System involving protective tariffs to protect manufacturing, and federal help to support new businesses, new sources of raw materials, and expanding the transportation network; an unprecedented level government intervention on behalf of Northern manufacturing and western producers. 

Traditional Republicans didn't like large government (and taxes), and southerners saw a big government as capable of coming after slaver who put forth Crawford instead.

The caucus nominated Crawford when Clay's members didn't show up, killing the caucus system but having state legislatures nominating him in the west, which Adams did in the North. Clay was speaker of the house and the 12th amendment had a contested election decided there, making him seen as likely to be the nominee. 

Andrew Jackson, hero of New Orleans with a volcanic temper, self-made, slave owner, orphaned, politician (quick quickly), Indian warrer (limited by Washington), duelist. He fought with Seminal Indians in Western Florida (like with the Creeks) and evicted the Spanish and hanged two British subjects. At the same time, President Monroe and Adams were delicately negotiation the purchase of Florida. The British almost declared war. Secretary of War Calhoun tried to get Monroe to repudiate Jackson, but he didn't and Adams smoothed over the situation with Spain anyway. 

Jackson was appointed governor of Florida but left quickly and found Tennessee (and his estate) racked by the Panic of 1819. Jackson was a Jeffersonian Republican, except he wanted total democracy, seeing Republican failures of the elite all around him. 

In 1824 Jackson swept the country, but hadn't hit a majority. The election was expected to break the American republic and was tossed to the House. 

## Election of 1824

In 1824 the election, three people were running including J.Q. Adams and Henry Clay. A fourth, Andrew Jackson entered in the west and this through off Clay's plan since he was speaker of the house and the 12th amendment sends a contested election to the House. Clay ended up coming in 4th in the electoral college and the 12th says only 3 are chosen between. 

Clay struck a bargain with J.Q. Adams to carry the National Republican agenda in return for appointment to Secretary of State. He worked over representatives, and this deal kind of shocked people. This was seen as a "Corrupt Bargain" (actual details of the deal are disputed) and sunk Adams' and Clay's careers and split the Republican party into the Democratic and National Republicans. 

Adams asks for an industrial, art, and science program in his State of the Union and amid the chaos of the fallout from the panic of 1819 coupled with the "corrupt bargain", the presidency is basically stalled. 

## Andrew Jackson

Jackson begins campaigning for 1828 and National Republicans choose Clay and Webster to lead the new party in reaction. Mudslinging ensues between newspapers. (Clay a corrupt bargainer and Jackson an adulterer). 

It was a landslide for Jackson and a marked shift towards Democracy from Classical Republicanism. A bunch of hillbillies celebrate in the white house (invasion of unwashed masses), but the shock of the smear campaign causes Jackson's wife to die (or at least she dies shortly after the election). 

Jackson sweeps out the old politicians and installs his own people including inexperienced and personal staff members in the "spoil system". By doing this, Jackson hoped to shake up the power structures held by people who were in office for a long time.

#### Tariff Bill

He chose to support farmers by reducing tariffs and vetoed tax bills for internal improvements (both shots at industry). He vetoes a highway bill across the country. Clay put together a compromise bill which Jackson signed, appalling southerners over Cotton tariffs. 

Calhoun (still VP) is so upset about this and states' rights that he proposed his home state South Carolina **nullify** the law, attempting to bluff congress into undoing the law. Daniel Webster absolutely flattens Calhoun's proxy arguer (see he was VP), instead calling for strength in the Union to obey federal law. Congress rejects the nullification agenda and Jackson supports Union. When the bill is signed Calhoun resigned. 

Calhoun urged South Carolina to nullify all the tariffs. Jackson threatened military deployment, putting an end to the effort. 

#### The Bank

Jackson now turned to the Second Bank of the US. 

The Bank was formally to serve as deposit for the U.S. Government, but also had the potential to turn into the central bank. It did two additional things:
1. Regulated the money supply by collecting taxes and customs duties in bank notes and then demanding specie from local banks for those notes, preventing those banks from issuing too many bank notes since the National Bank was always looming to demand specie (and it did vice versa in downturns), loosely regulating the economy. 
2. The bank, a private-public partnership, owed responsibility to non-government shareholders who encouraged investment in internal improvement and industry. 

Democratic Republicans saw this concentration of power as too great and the implementation of it as against the interest of the people (who own it). They also saw the US bank as usurping state banks with more legitimate bank notes. The oldest argument, Jackson also believed the bank exceeded the authority of the government. Instead, Jackson wants the Bank to just be a deposit system. The National Bank did not do much to stave off these accusations, first poorly run and then myopically politically interested. 

But still, the charter was good and Congress was not about to undo it. In a foolish attempt to outdo Jackson, the Bank president and Clay push for the rechartering to be done early, seeing it as a win-win for them. Jackson vetoed the bank, but congress did not override the veto as was expected and the bank went down. Jackson seized the moral high-ground, calling the veto an act of class warfare in support of the people against the elites. 

In 1832 Clay is embarrassed again at the ballot box. Jackson seeks to finally kill the bank by removing its political influence by withdrawing all funds and depositing in various state banks. The Secretary of the Treasury refused and was fired. His replacement refused and was also fired. Tawney is appointed and finally carries out the act. 

The bank recalls loans and causes some economic damage in response but Jackson successfully puts the blame back on the bank. 

Jackson further secures victory by issuing a specie declaration for the West, meaning the only money that could be used was hard coin; and also by appointing Tawney to SCOTUS after Marshall died.
