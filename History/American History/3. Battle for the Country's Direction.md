# Republicans and Federalists

Early on, conflicts were along faction lines. Temporary and more personal, but parties soon emerged from the Hamilton/Jefferson split and could live past defeats and people.

The new government was in debt and Hamilton had ideas. He believed in progress and growth. He believed state jealousies should be kept in balance and at bay, while U.S. independence was linked to its success economically. Hamilton recommended three things: 

1. The federal government will commit to its financial obligations, and pay all war debt, including all state war debt. This will make America a trusted partner on the world stage and aid those Americans from whom the government accepted loans. Many people believed securities were phony and risky so they shouldn't be paid back, or that this was a new government and not beholden to the old commitments. Paid by raising tariffs, a 25% excise tax on whisky, creating a national bank.
2. Create a national bank as a public-private partnership, which the government could use to manage money and use its notes as currency. The governments involvement would serve to guarantee the bank, and profits would help pay debt.

> Banks make their money by accepting hard, real money, aka specie; they don't actually loan out specie, but bank notes which are paper certificates that promise specie on demand and bank notes become circulating currency. 
   
   There were no banks in North America. A bank is a legal means to pool private wealth and make available to loan to entrepreneurs. The British were skeptical of anything giving concentrations of power to the colonies, and colonists like Jefferson believed banking infected people with hopes of unreal wealth: he thought it odd and suspicious. 
3. Build American manufacturing and diversify beyond agriculture using the bank to fund industry and tariffs to make American products more appealing. Also lift immigration barriers to bring in cheap labor to produce those goods.

Jefferson, southerners (generally), and opponents generally view Hamilton's plan as an assault on farmers. They see merchants who benefit from banking as the future corruptors and see banks as a source for swindlers at the expense of the honest farmers. They see agriculture as the heart of the nation and not "ostentatious" manufacturing. 

They also see it as illegal since it wasn't explicitly listed in the Constitution, but this established the principle of implied powers since when the Constitution defines an end, it implies the means to get there, such as regulating commerce and other things in the Constitution. 

Hamilton eventually got all he wanted. Congress was vested in the interest of manufacturing but also Washington was behind him. Jefferson resigned, and the money flowed in. 

Something about moving the capitol. 

Madison, not Jefferson, organizes the democratic republicans (Republicans). Despite his support for Hamilton in the conventions, he was a Virginia slave owner and organized opposition, based on agriculturalists and old anti-federalists skeptical of the government. 

Hamilton sees these party politics and their tactics as an affront to the Constitution and repeats as much as Federalists. They have success in Congress, but don't really do much organizing. 

The French Revolution happens and the Monarchy is replaced, Jefferson is overjoyed as Secretary of State. The revolution turned bloody and Hamilton warned Washington against getting involved. Jefferson's delight embarrassed Republicans and French envoy commissioned American merchant ships to attack British ships, incensing Washington as the last thing the country needed.

Still the Federalists fumbled fast with whisky taxes. Whisky was a useful byproduct for agriculturalists and the tax became a burden on them and they fought back. Hamilton and Washington suppressed the rebellion, indicating the success of the new government for this test, but the start of the Federalist troubles. In 1795 an unequal British treaty is signed. Washington stated his intent not to run again, resultantly his legend wouldn't support Federalists anymore. 

Adams won the next election narrowly, and so before the 11th amendment Jefferson became the VP as runner up. He wasn't really popular with anyone, obviously for Jeffersonians but he also didn't care much for regulation, protectionism, or the bank. 

The first scandal is a foreign policy one of the French, terrible PR for Jefferson. By the Adams administration, the reign of terror was over and the French government was a 5-man directory in a war with anti-revolutionaries Austria, Prussia, Spain, Great Britain. Wanted American sympathy and support from trade and finance. American trade was, however, menaced by the British who started seizing ships in the French Caribbean. Washington didn't want another war and sent Jay to make a treaty, hence the terrible one he made earlier. 

The French directory felt betrayed by the treaty and engaged in their own menacing of American ships, hoping to bully them into renouncing the treaty and resuming unrestricted trade. 

Adams sent three men to France to sort this out. They were only allowed to see a foreign minister, Talleyrand, and three officials (XYZ - XYZ affair) suggested the Americans Bribe the minister and loan the directory money as atonement for the treaty. The Americans outright rejected and left. 

This obviously enraged congress and the public. Congress abrogated all French treaties, authorized the seizure of French ships, and a bunch of money for the American Army and Navy. An undeclared Naval "Quasi-War" broke out on the oceans.

This all ruined Jefferson and republicans as French sympathizers as Jacobins, while Federalists were vaunted praise. But Adams pulled defeat from the jaws of victory. Adams and Federalists passed the alien sedition acts and then reopened negotiations with the French directory. 

The alien and sedition acts were four bills set to enable the country to weed out traitors. 
* Naturalization act - increased amount of time from 5 to 14 years for an alien to become an American citizen. Aimed to keep power out of foreign-born populations. 
* Act concerning aliens, act concerning alien enemies - gave president sweeping powers to act against alien immigrants or deport them suspect of being treasonous.
* Sedition act - Heavy fines and imprisonment on Natives for "false" writing, speaking, or publishing scandalous information against the president or congress. 
The arrests from these acts were anti-federalist carnivals. Jefferson and Madison draw up Virginia and Kentucky resolutions criticizing the government and the acts as overreach and calling for states to nullify them, up to secession. Other states and congress don't really do much else. 

The French armies are taken over by Napoleon and then their fleets are annihilated, removing their threat and abating fears against them, and people called for repeal of the acts and demobilize army. At this point Adams states intent to reopen negotiations, tarnishing his image, even with Hamilton.

In 1800, Federalist divisions sink the party and Jefferson wins, effectively ending the Federalist party.

## Republicanism and its Frustration

Jefferson sees his election as a new start and revolution of 1800, even inaugurated in Washington. He begins with a reaction- restricting military size, endorsing total neutrality (no British concessions) with free trade and commerce (no tariffs for American manufacturers), and dismantling government structure, and pay off the debt. He does speak to treat Federalists with grace in a smooth transition of power, a real watershed moment. 

Adams appoints a bunch of last minute judges (Midnight Appointments). But Jefferson's administration was more moderate. He didn't extend voting rights, and states actually restricted voting rights, some removing voting right from free blacks, others from women. Jefferson did nothing and instead urged congress to give landless men land, to allow them to vote but also to make them farmers. Jefferson's society was equal for landed men, but no one else. He wasn't an enemy of small industry either. He was also a slave owner.  

Jefferson was also pretty incompetent as an administrator. He couldn't pay the debt or kill the taxes and feared what would happen if he repudiated the debt. He didn't kill the national bank.

He did shrink the military and Navy, but the Barbary Coast (North Africa) pirates demanded higher bribes and Jefferson attempted war with them but it was a boondoggle (Barbary wars).

The French under Napoleon go to war with the British again and blockade the isles. The British counter-blockaded the French. American ships were now total sitting ducks and the British this time particularly bothered American ships. They stop the Chesapeake (Chesapeake Incident) looking for deserters, who denies the British to come aboard, who fire upon it, and then haul off American citizens, enraging Americans even more than the XYZ affair. 

Jefferson had no fleet so he implemented a boycott and embargo against both powers. This crippled American exports and imports and caused economic sinking. 

#supremecourt The courts deal a large blow as well in three separate cases under Marshall:
* Marbury vs. Madison - Adams late appointments to the Judiciary are ignores and Madison (sec of state at the time) doesn't deliver their signed commissions and Marbury sued. The court decided Marbury's application was invalid on technicality, but that had it been filed correctly would have been affirmed. This established the power of judicial review of Federal Legislation. 
* Martin vs. Hunter's Lessee - Martin's loyalist lands were confiscated and sold to Hunter. Virginia denied the suit, but the Federal Jay treaty granted protection to loyalist property. SCOTUS ruled in Martin's favor, establishing Federal Supremacy. 
* McCullough vs. Maryland - Maryland attempted to break the national bank's power by issuing a tax on the bank's notes. McCullough refused to pay, insisting the state had no sovereignty to tax Federal jurisdiction. Maryland sued on the basis of the old Jeffersonian argument that the bank wasn't explicit in the Constitution, but SCOTUS affirmed implied powers.

Jefferson and Madison, frustrated by all of this. 

## Westward Expansion

Americans feared nothing more early on than to be crushed and conquered by European powers. Federalists accused the Republicans of selling the country to the French and vice versa for the British. 

Jefferson declared his absolute neutrality; believed American self sufficiency and agriculturalism were the key. Wanted to expand to lands westward, which had been growing quickly. Lowers price of government land in west, makes it possible to get smaller lots, and turned a bling eye to squatting. 

The growth west (Ohio became a state quickly) made it more necessary to use the Mississippi river for shipping goods. Spain owned New Orleans, which Napoleon soon bullied the Spanish into transferring to the French. Napoleon wanted to reignite French interests in North America, and the key was in French Hispaniola as a base. He sent his Brother to reconquer the island from the Black Slave revolution that had occurred amidst the French Revolution chaos. 

This spooked the colonists, traffic in the gulf from the MS could be held hostage to coax Americans into free trade, or tempt states to join that empire. 

But LeClerc failed to reconquer the island and so Louisiana was useless to Napoleon. Jefferson had sent Monroe to try and buy New Orleans, but Napoleon responded (through Talleyrand) by offering it all for $15m and they accepted. The purchase was complete by Treaty of Session in 1803. Jefferson, against his own conscience, purchased the territory even though it wasn't explicitly allowed in the constitution.

In the hasty sale, no one really knew the boundaries or the contents of Louisiana, and Jefferson commissioned a scouting party up the Missouri River Valley and to the Pacific, Lewis and Clarke (which he almost did in secret anyway), to map the territory and evaluate the area (and one last attempt to find a NW passage). The expedition was a huge success (and also they found Sacajawea), but they figure the area wasn't fit for whites? Zebulon Pike also makes a few expeditions.

Trappers move in to find valuable fur in the Rockies and forts are established to deal with this trade. 

#### Treason

Aaron Burr, an ally of Jeffersonians and Jefferson's VP (only the first time), collided with Hamilton and provoked him into a duel killing him, and both parties denounced him ending his career in politics, beginning his career in treason. While he was still technically VP opened negotiations with the British and claimed that western states were unhappy and willing to secede, dividing the republic with the British government's finance. He even recruited some people and got the commander of the New Orleans garrison to cooperate. 

Burr armed his troops and declared his intent to capture Baton Rouge; but the commander, Wilkinson, got cold feet and called in the local militia. Burr, upon hearing this, deserted the group and fled to West Florida, but was captured on the way. The case against Burr by the US Government was not solid and it became a referendum on Jefferson. Marshall quashed the case and Burr went off Scott-free. 

All of this culminated in a general failure of Jefferson's government and he retired after two terms. 

#### Agrarianism

Jefferson believed that commerce meant dependence on customers, and that meant subservience and abandonment of virtue, and instead that farmers were the only true virtuous. Despite all of Hamilton's actions, the country was still mostly farmers, and quite rural. 

In the 1700s, the British emerged as dominant capitalists and wanted its colonies to be suppliers, not rivals. Colonial merchants were often restricted. Capitalism meaning the exchange of goods at a profit and the conversion of those profits into goods. The British had favorable politics, geography, and the merchant marine. They converted most of their currency into portable paper money by bills of exchange or with bank notes (in contrast with barter); meaning all money is valued the same and money is portable. All of this is to say America was deliberately rural in part due to the British. 

But American culture was also agrarian. They had a passion for independence without aristocratic noblemen owning the land and as much as they wanted, land was everywhere; owning was huge and with that power was diffused. Non-market agriculture dominated, most goods were for household or local use. The economy was a subsistence-surplus economy. Most goods were consumed at home and the rest was used to barter for other goods. This also meant cash-cropping was not dominant, nor really was cash at all. 

Face to face barter created tight knit communities. Debts were local, small, and frequent, and often wasn't even collected; and bartering was done face-to-face.

But rural farmer childbearing then caused issues, they couldn't perpetuate the cycle, hence the push westward bringing new states into the union, and bringing clashes with North American woodland Indians. 

Native Americans were scarcely seen as human beings. They were organized into tribes, but they were porous and could form larger federated tribes. Individual tribal membership varied and could even include whites or other tribal members. Indian tribes mirrored agrarians: patriarchal with labor divided by gender and age. Men did hunting, fishing, and occasional war. Women did agriculture and child-rearing. Indians learned to carry out trade with whites. They also played white groups against each other. 

Until the French and Indian war when they threw their support behind the French losers. They did the same with the British in the revolution. Now Americans pouring in, Indians either accommodated, grudgingly selling land to whites in return for protection or guarantees of settlement further west. Sometimes they converted to white ways and became agrarian, adopting legal codes and Constitutions (sometimes even adopting slavery). 

Or, they resisted. In Ohio and Kentucky, for example the Shawnee tribe's Tecumseh created a general Indian confederation and in 1811 created a large union of Indian tribes. William Henry Harrison organized a militia to attack their capital Prophetstown on the Tippecanoe river while Tecumseh was away and his brother lead an attack against Harrison who destroyed them and burned the town. The alliance fell apart and Tecumseh fled to Canada.

This became a deadly cycle, and the British in Canada stoked the flames out of fear of American expansionism. This lead Americans in the short term to simply pre-emptively striking Indians, but long term to plotting against the British threat from Canada.
## The War of 1812

In 1807, American ships in Macao were boarded and assaulted by British ships. The Jefferson embargo had been killed and the Federalists ran a scorching campaign in 1808. Madison was still Republican to succeed Jefferson, but congress was more divided, and new western representatives were more extreme. 

Henry Clay, enemy of the bank, aristocrats, corporations, was elected to the KY senate, and helped kill the bank. In addition, he viewed Indians as a British plot to slow the growth of America. He sees this, in addition to the British shipping incidents as plotting to undue the revolution. He wasn't alone, and his group was the War Hawks who wanted to hold Canada hostage to make the British behave and maybe add it to the US. 

In 1812, Madison's Secretary of State Monroe had obtained a letter from a Canadian crackpot calling to detach New England and join with Canada. The Henry Papers were forwarded to Congress, and War Hawks use this to push Madison to war; they declared their support for the election of 1812 hinged on this and they declared war. 

12 years of Republicanism had underfunded the budget and especially the military, but they believed Napoleon's war would tie down the British. It was a total embarrassment. Near Detroit they were captured without a shot and in NY/NE they basically deserted. The next year wasn't any better. 

In the Navy, Perry had successfully captured the British squadron, making upper Canada indefensible abandoning upper Canada to William Henry Harrison. Tecumseh persuades the British to make a last stand but they were overrun and he was shot down. 

In 1814, after some losses, but with reinforcements freed from Napoleon's war, the British counter attacked. They moved south from Montreal to NYC (failed), raided the American coast, burning the Capitol (the defense of Baltimore soon after inspired the National Anthem), and headed to New Orleans (see below). 

The only dub was the American Navy, scoring some sick wins against the notorious British. The Army only really had success against Indians stirred up by Tecumseh in the south, where Andrew Jackson crushed them at Horseshoe Bend, forcing them to yield a shit ton of MI land. He set off against some other Indians and claimed Pensacola in West Florida. He threw off the British in New Orleans.

The Americans were broke from the few battles already, choked by British blockades, lacking new recruits, and the European wars were coming to an end. The British, also suffering from war weariness, offered to open direct negotiations. The negotiated in Ghent, but NE was preparing to make a separate peace and secede if their demands weren't met, but the peace had already been signed when they arrived in D.C. with their demands.
