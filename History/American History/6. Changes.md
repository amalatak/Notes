## New Parties

The bank war finalized the split within the Republican party that had begun in 1824. The National Republicans had their own (and first in the US) party convention in 1832 and at the recommendation of Clay took a new name in 1834, the Whigs. 

The Whigs were committed to small-scale urban business and finance, and trans-Atlantic trade. They also got support from large-scale agriculture. They preferred regulating trade to manage it, including with high, protective tariffs, subsidies to internal improvements, transportation technology, and a bank. Morally, they believed in a Christian consensus of personal morality (I think they don't like Alcohol and don't really care about industry evils). Finally, they believe in national unity. They were based on reason and rationality. 

It was, however, suspicious of popular democracy. They believed that enlightened, non-aristocratic, independently wealthy people could govern society. 

Jackson's democrats weren't exactly "of the people" either. The chief benefactors were state banks and southern slave owners. 

Whigs thought of freedom as freedom from restraints of localism, while Democrats thought of it as freedom from concentrations of wealth and power. 

The Whigs became to resemble European bourgeoisie, while Democrats came to increasingly defend slave-based agriculture and industrial workers in the way European socialism did. Whigs supported economic diversity and cultural uniformity, while the Democrats supported economic unity and equality and cultural diversity. The Whigs were the party of optimism while the Democrats were the party of fear and reaction. 

#### Panic of 1837

Van Buren ended up easily winning the election of 1836, but he sucked and in 1837 there was a panic caused by English mills slowing down which reduced cotton demand and lenders cashed in on southern bank notes causing a run on Southern banks where Jacksons Pet banks had collected the forced specie. 

Without a national bank to regulate currency, U.S. money went into freefall in the panic and Van Buren never recovered. He tried to make a deposit-only US bank but that only served to restrict the money supply further. 

#### End of Republican Dominance

Whig party leadership dumped Clay and nominated William Henry Harrison, who trounced Van Buren. 

## American Romanticism

Ralph Waldo Emerson spoke in 1837 that the U.S. was philosophically only a shade of Europe. Which wasn't really true, American education and literacy was actually ok, but it was based in Enlightenment principles which largely are what the prior revivals had been a reaction to. 

Enlightenment principles, Scottish reason, etc were sometimes seen as unbelief. Landscape portraits became more popular, and the American legal system was criticized as lifeless and cold, instead pushing for justice based on honesty. 

New Romantic thinking originated in Europe pushing for admiration of nature, revolt against formality and cold logic, glorification of emotion/sublime, and the cult of the artist. American romanticism became intertwined with religious movements and morphed into its own, Transcendentalism. 

## Reforms

Immigrants were a group Americans somewhat feared as pliable by European influence to destroy America. Churches played a key role in American optimism (and it's pessimism). How better to convert people than to persuade them of the power of self improvement, and with that world improvement. This lead to a lot of reforms including some anti-slavery movements and protective tariffs for wages. It was also slightly hubristic and self interested. 

Protestant optimism was rooted in a vision of a world that lead a protestant way of life; but, also churches wanted to use the movements to recapture their lost position of moral arbiters of society. They had no chance at state authority like in Europe, but they could be important as groups with ideas more so than they could be as church organizations. 

Side note- this is also when those weird independent groups popped up like Shakers, Millerites, Mormons, etc. They chose to separate from society instead of seek to change it due to a more pessimistic long term view about corrupt society, but an optimism about founding a new Jerusalem. 

Secular movements popped up as well, such as workers movements, public education groups, health groups, the temperance movement. Some followed the track of the "come-outers" and retracted from society such as some transcendentals tried communal living; and so did some anti-capitalists. 

Secular groups didn't have as much staying power, however, since they tended to make more enemies and reached for measurable (and by extension- measurable to fail sometimes) goals. Immigrants clashed with the temperance movement over booze, and eventually the movement passed prohibition laws that just didn't work. 

#### Men and Women

Historically in Europe, men did the work as providers and leaders while women functioned to provide children and do supporting roles. The patterns in America were different- labor shortages often drove women into jobs where in Europe they would not, and they even got the right to vote in some states.

As such, marriage became a union of equals based on love and companionship. Men were out of the house (from the farm of old) in the factories now, leaving women in a unique position running the house. In addition, even public schooling became more popular. Separately, men's natural physical strength was no longer important in a factory where quickness and agility mattered more. Women quickly moved into textile factories. Their traditional roles were being eroded by machines and they partly became status symbols in some circles and consumers in others. 

There's a women's rights convention in Seneca Falls, and then a big voting rights convention.

In some levels all of these reforms drew criticism and reaction, but de Tocqueville saw them as a sign of a healthy American society.
