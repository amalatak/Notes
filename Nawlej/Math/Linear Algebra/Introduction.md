**Definition**
Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that studies vectors, matrices, and linear transformations.

**Vectors** 
A vector is a mathematical representation of something that has magnitude and direction. Generally is a type of **tuple**, which is just an ordered list of elements. 

Vectors can be parameterized in a number of different coordinate spaces, be it all real numbers, complex, etc. For example

$$
\vec{v} \in \mathbb{R}^2
$$

The above would define some two-tuple (vector) in the real number coordinate space. 

To add vectors, simply add them. They must be the same dimension. Might see something like $\vec{a}, \vec{b} \in \mathbb{R}^n$
